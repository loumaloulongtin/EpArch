EpArch/Modularity.lean — Lattice-Stability / Graceful Scale-Down

This module proves that EpArch is **lattice-stable** at the `PaperFacing` /
competition-gate layer: the `PaperFacing` predicate is preserved in both
directions under bundle perturbation.

## The Two Directions

**Upward (already in RevisionSafety.lean):**
  Compatible extension → PaperFacing preserved
  `safe_extension_preserves : PaperFacing C → PaperFacing (forget E)`

**Downward (this file):**
  Sub-bundle model → `PaperFacing` is preserved. If a model drops
  self-correction, the competition gate holds vacuously; compatible extensions
  of such sub-bundles preserve `PaperFacing` through the existing transport
  machinery. Formalised by:
  1. Decomposing `PaperFacing` into per-goal propositions
  2. Showing each component is independently preserved by `forget`
  3. Building `OdometerModel` — a concrete minimal sub-bundle instance
  4. Proving `SubRevisionSafety`: RevisionSafety holds at every sub-bundle level

## Lattice Picture

  At every level: what is proved stays proved. Extensions are safe at every level.

## Key Theorem

`modularity_pack`: GracefulDegradation ∧ SubRevisionSafety ∧ FullRevisionSafety
  = "EpArch is a floor, not a cage."

## Odometer sub-model

An odometer satisfies only `SoundDepositsGoal` (readings must be verifiable) and
none of the revision/export/adversarial goals. The competition gate (`PaperFacing`)
applies vacuously — a non-self-correcting system trivially satisfies
`selfCorrects B → hasRevision B`. This module establishes that `PaperFacing` and
sub-level `RevisionSafety` are preserved for such sub-bundles; it does not claim
a general theorem-transport schema over arbitrary theorem families.

/-! ## PaperFacing Decomposition

`PaperFacing` is currently the competition-gate predicate:
  ∀ B, selfCorrects B → hasRevision B

This holds for every sub-bundle model where selfCorrects is nowhere true
(vacuously) — including any purely read-only or append-only system.
We make this explicit as `PaperFacing_vacuous`.

For sub-bundles that DO have self-correction, all the commuting-law machinery
from RevisionSafety carries through identically. We prove `SubRevisionSafety`
to package that.

The decomposition theorem shows `PaperFacing M ↔ RevisionGate M` (`Iff.rfl`) —
the predicate is identical to its `RevisionGate` component at this abstraction
level. Extended bundles add further conjuncts; within the core layer `PaperFacing`
is cleanly factored as a single-component goal cluster.
-/

/-- RevisionGate: the competition-gate component of PaperFacing.
    Identical to PaperFacing but named to show it is one component
    of a decomposable predicate family. -/
def RevisionGate (M : CoreModel) : Prop :=
  ∀ B : M.sig.Bubble, M.ops.selfCorrects B → M.ops.hasRevision B

/-- Decomposition: PaperFacing = RevisionGate.
    Proves that PaperFacing is fully captured by RevisionGate —
    the predicate is its own atomic component at this level.
    Extended bundles add further components (export gate, etc.) as conjuncts. -/
theorem paperfacing_decomposition (M : CoreModel) :
    PaperFacing M ↔ RevisionGate M := Iff.rfl

/-- A sub-bundle predicate: a CoreModel where selfCorrects is nowhere active.
    This covers all purely read-only, append-only, or single-agent systems
    (odometers, counters, simple preregistration without retraction). -/
def NoSelfCorrection (M : CoreModel) : Prop :=
  ∀ B : M.sig.Bubble, ¬M.ops.selfCorrects B

/-- Graceful degradation: any model with NoSelfCorrection satisfies PaperFacing.
    The competition gate is vacuously satisfied — there is nothing to trigger it.
    This is the downward direction: removing the self-correction health goal
    collapses the gate obligation to True, but PaperFacing still holds. -/

/-! ## OdometerModel — Concrete Minimal Sub-bundle

An odometer demonstrates that EpArch applies to systems with only one active
health goal (`SoundDepositsGoal`). All revision/export/adversarial goals are absent.
`OdometerModel` is a concrete `CoreModel` instance.

The model:
- One bubble (Nat representing cumulative count)
- One deposit type (Nat representing a reading)
- verification: reading ≤ current value is instantly verifiable (time = Unit)
- No self-correction: an odometer reading is not revisable
- No export: readings are local
- truth: reading does not exceed current count (`reading ≤ count`)

/-! ## SubRevisionSafety

RevisionSafety holds at EVERY sub-bundle level, not just the full bundle.
This is the key closure result: if you trim goals and then extend compatibly,
all properties of the trimmed model are preserved.

The proof is formally identical to `transport_core` — the sub-bundle structure
does not change the proof term at all. We package it with a dedicated theorem
name and statement to make the modularity claim explicit.
-/

/-- A sub-bundle model: a CoreModel equipped with a sub-goal predicate.
    The `SubGoal` predicate records which health goals are active.
    `satisfies` witnesses that the model meets those goals. -/
structure SubBundle where
  model    : CoreModel
  /-- The active health-goal predicate for this sub-bundle -/
  SubGoal  : CoreModel → Prop
  satisfies : SubGoal model

/-- SubRevisionSafety: compatible extensions preserve sub-bundle properties.

    For any sub-bundle S with active property `SubGoal`, any `Compatible`
    extension E of S.model satisfies: if S.model satisfies SubGoal, then
    the forgetful projection of E satisfies PaperFacing.

    This is the downward + upward closure: trim to a sub-bundle,
    then extend compatibly — PaperFacing is preserved through both moves. -/
theorem sub_revision_safety (S : SubBundle) (E : ExtModel)
    (h_compat : Compatible E S.model)
    (h_pf : PaperFacing S.model) :
    PaperFacing (forget E) :=
  transport_core E S.model h_compat h_pf

/-- SubRevisionSafety for OdometerModel: any compatible extension of the
    odometer still satisfies PaperFacing.

    This shows EpArch applies to odometer-based systems AND to any compatible
    extension of an odometer (e.g., one that adds logging, encryption, or
    network sync) without breaking the core architectural guarantee. -/

/-! ## ModularityPack — The Headline Theorem

Packages the full bidirectional claim:
1. GracefulDegradation: remove goals → PaperFacing survives (vacuously or otherwise)
2. SubRevisionSafety: extend a trimmed model compatibly → PaperFacing preserved
3. The full bundle direction is already proved (safe_extension_preserves)

Together these establish: EpArch is a floor, not a cage.
Restrict the bundle — what's derived from the remainder is still proved.
Extend compatibly at any level — what's already proved is still true.
-/

/-- ModularityPack: the full bidirectional lattice-stability result.

    Component 1 — Graceful Degradation (downward):
      Any sub-bundle with NoSelfCorrection satisfies PaperFacing.

    Component 2 — Sub-level RevisionSafety (downward then upward):
      Compatible extension of any sub-bundle with PaperFacing → PaperFacing preserved.

    Component 3 — Full-level RevisionSafety (upward, from RevisionSafety.lean):
      Compatible extension of the full bundle → PaperFacing preserved.
