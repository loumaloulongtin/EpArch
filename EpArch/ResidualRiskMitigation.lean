EpArch.ResidualRiskMitigation — Residual Risk Mitigation Coverage and Minimality

Classification theorem: every residual-risk mode induced by bounded autonomous
novelty handling is covered by a prescribed EpArch mechanism.

Grounded coverage layer: companion proof-grounded relation where each constructor
carries upstream theorem evidence or structural field/projection evidence.

Grounded mode layer: structural evidence showing each mode is backed by
upstream theorem evidence, not an arbitrary taxonomy choice.

Minimality layer: every mechanism is necessary — removing any one leaves some
obligation uncovered (relative minimality w.r.t. the obligation taxonomy).

/-! ## ResidualRiskMode — Structural Failure Mode Taxonomy

The nine distinct failure modes that remain once risk-free autonomous novelty
handling is unavailable.  Each constructor names a mode, not an implementation
defect.  The modes exist because the operating regime (bounded verification +
PRP + novel inputs) generates them structurally; see
`residual_risk_forced_when_no_scratch_no_escalation` in `EpArch.Health`. -/

    novelty handling is unavailable.  Each constructor names a mode, not an
    implementation defect: the mode exists because the operating regime (bounded
    verification + PRP + novel inputs) generates it structurally.

    - `scopeLeak`:         a claim valid in one bubble is silently imported and
                           relied on outside the scope where it was verified.
    - `standardMismatch`:  no explicit acceptance threshold; the wrong standard
                           is applied at reliance time.
    - `unmodeledError`:    known failure modes or uncertainty are not recorded;
                           they propagate silently through bridge reliance.
    - `provenanceGap`:     source / chain dependency is invisible at reliance time;
                           bridge origin cannot be audited or challenged.
    - `staleness`:         a time-sensitive claim is relied on past its freshness
                           window; no mechanism enforces temporal validity.
    - `adversarialImport`: an untrusted actor submits or promotes a deposit;
                           no authorization gate is enforced.
    - `unrevokedDefect`:   a defective deposit is not revoked; the challenge and
                           correction path is absent or blocked.
    - `overbudgetReliance`: bridge reliance hides the verification gap and is
                           treated operationally as if it were scratch
                           verification; the gap is unlabelled rather than
                           structurally absent.
    - `unsafeAutonomy`:    autonomous action is taken without a sound non-action
                           branch; the escalation path is structurally absent. -/

/-! ## Coverage Theorem

`eparch_surface_covers_residual_risk_modes` is the capstone classification
theorem: every declared residual-risk mode is answered by some EpArch
mechanism.  The proof is zero-cost — each `cases r` branch supplies the
matching `Mitigates` constructor. -/

/-- EPARCH SURFACE COVERS FORCED RESIDUAL RISK MODES

    Every residual-risk mode induced by bounded autonomous novelty handling
    is covered by an EpArch mechanism that makes that mode an auditable
    operational obligation rather than an unstructured failure possibility.

    **Theorem shape:** `∀ r : ResidualRiskMode, ∃ m : EpArchMechanism, Mitigates m r`
    **Proof strategy:** `cases r`; supply the matching `Mitigates` constructor.

    This theorem is a classification theorem, not an impossibility theorem.
    The structural depth lives in `residual_risk_forced_when_no_scratch_no_escalation`
    and related theorems in `EpArch.Health`: those results explain why the
    nine risk modes are not arbitrary.  This theorem shows that EpArch's
    surface is *complete* with respect to those modes — no mode is left
    unaddressed.

    Does not say: the mechanisms eliminate the underlying risk.  `Mitigates m r`
    states that mechanism `m` converts risk mode `r` into an auditable obligation;
    whether that obligation is correctly discharged is a system-level property,
    not an architectural guarantee.

    Does not say: each mechanism addresses exactly one mode.  The existence
    theorem requires only coverage; multiple mechanisms may address the same
    mode, and a single mechanism may address multiple modes.

    Exhaustiveness: this theorem is exhaustive over the declared
    `ResidualRiskMode` inductive.  Adding a new constructor to
    `ResidualRiskMode` breaks the proof until a new `Mitigates` constructor
    and a new case branch are supplied — the coverage guarantee is
    machine-checked, not informal. -/

    GROUNDED COVERAGE LAYER — Proof-Backed Mitigation Evidence
    ========================================================================

    `eparch_surface_covers_residual_risk_modes` establishes declared coverage:
    every `ResidualRiskMode` has some `Mitigates` pairing — constructors are
    definitional evidence backed by doc-comment reasoning.

    `GroundedMitigates` is a companion inductive where each constructor carries
    *actual proof evidence* — either an upstream theorem (applied to its real
    inputs) or a structural projection from an existing field.  This makes
    coverage machine-verifiable in depth, not just in classification.

    Does not prove strict minimality or irredundancy of the surface; irredundancy
    is handled separately.
    Each upstream-theorem case carries the theorem as a function value.
    Structural cases carry either field-projection evidence (proved by `rfl`) or
    a small proof from an existing structural field, such as `PathExists.ttl_valid`. -/

/-! ## GroundedMitigates — Proof-Backed Coverage Relation -/

/-- `GroundedMitigates m r` is the proof-backed companion to `Mitigates m r`.

    Each constructor carries an actual evidence argument: either an upstream
    theorem (as a function applied to its proper hypotheses) or a structural
    projection from a required field.  The evidence is not a bare constructor
    tag but a proof obligation whose content can be inspected.

    - Upstream-theorem constructors carry a universally-quantified function
      whose body is an application of the named theorem.
    - Structural constructors carry either a field-projection proposition
      proved by `rfl` (confirming the required field exists and is accessible)
      or a small proof obligation over an existing structural field
      (for example, `tau_staleness` derives `False` from `τ = 0 ∧ PathExists.ttl_valid`
      via `simp` rather than a plain field projection).

    `grounded_mitigation_implies_mitigation` shows this relation implies
    `Mitigates`; `eparch_surface_groundedly_covers_residual_risk_modes`
    proves grounded coverage exhaustively. -/

/-- EPARCH SURFACE GROUNDEDLY COVERS RESIDUAL RISK MODES.

    Every residual-risk mode has a mitigation pairing backed by upstream theorem
    evidence or structural field-projection evidence.  This strengthens
    `eparch_surface_covers_residual_risk_modes`: the grounding confirms that each
    pairing is not merely a taxonomy claim but reflects structural or proof-level
    constraints in the formalization.

    **Theorem shape:** `∀ r : ResidualRiskMode, ∃ m : EpArchMechanism, GroundedMitigates m r`
    **Proof strategy:** `cases r`; supply the matching `GroundedMitigates` constructor
    with the actual proof witness for each mode.

    `GroundedMitigates` has eleven constructors but this proof uses nine — one per
    `ResidualRiskMode` constructor.  `redeemability_defect` and
    `bounded_recall_overbudget` are not used here because `unrevokedDefect` and

    GROUNDED MODE LAYER — Structural Evidence for the Mode Taxonomy
    ========================================================================

    `GroundedRiskMode r` witnesses that residual-risk mode `r` is backed by
    upstream structural evidence — not merely introduced as a label.  Each
    constructor carries the relevant theorem (from `EpArch.Minimality` or
    `EpArch.Health`) that establishes the structural ground for the mode.

    `all_modes_structurally_grounded` shows every mode in the taxonomy has such
    backing.  `all_modes_grounded_and_groundedly_covered` is the bilateral
    capstone: every mode is both structurally grounded and proof-backed addressed.
    The two grounded sides are:
    - `GroundedRiskMode r`     — mode is backed by upstream structural evidence
    - `GroundedMitigates m r`  — mode is addressed with machine-checked evidence -/

/-! ## GroundedRiskMode — Structural Evidence for Each Mode -/

/-- `GroundedRiskMode r` carries upstream structural evidence that mode `r` is
    backed by a real structural constraint — not merely introduced as a label.

    function applied to its proper model-structure type.

    This is the mode-taxonomy companion to `GroundedMitigates`: where
    `GroundedMitigates m r` proves mechanism `m` addresses mode `r`,
    `GroundedRiskMode r` provides the upstream structural grounding for mode `r`.

    `all_modes_structurally_grounded` instantiates every constructor from the
    named theorems in `EpArch.Minimality` and `EpArch.Health`. -/

/-- ALL MODES ARE STRUCTURALLY GROUNDED AND GROUNDEDLY COVERED (bilateral capstone).

    Every residual-risk mode is:
    (1) structurally grounded — backed by an upstream structural theorem, not
        merely introduced as a label, and
    (2) proof-backed addressed — some EpArch mechanism converts it into an
        auditable operational obligation, with machine-checked evidence.

    Together these answer two distinct challenges:
    - "the modes are an arbitrary taxonomy" — answered by `GroundedRiskMode r`
    - "the coverage is mere classification" — answered by `GroundedMitigates m r`

    **Theorem shape:**
    `∀ r, GroundedRiskMode r ∧ ∃ m : EpArchMechanism, GroundedMitigates m r`

    RELATIVE MINIMALITY OF THE RESIDUAL-RISK MITIGATION SURFACE
    ========================================================================

    Coverage (above) proves every residual-risk mode is answered by some
    mechanism.  The theorems below prove the converse direction and
    irredundancy:

    - Non-idleness: every mechanism addresses at least one risk mode.
    - Surface infrastructure: definitions for surface-subset coverage.
    - Obligation coverage: the full surface covers every obligation.
    - Removal irredundancy: removing any mechanism leaves some obligation
      uncovered (the minimality result).

    The minimality result is relative: minimal with respect to the declared
    `ResidualRiskObligation` taxonomy derived from bounded autonomous PRP
    handling.  It does not claim minimality among all possible epistemic
    architectures.

    The `ResidualRiskObligation` taxonomy refines `ResidualRiskMode`
    at the two `GroundedMitigates` seams where coverage had overlap:
    - `unrevokedDefect` splits into `lifecycleDefect` + `redeemabilityGap`
    - `overbudgetReliance` splits into `hiddenBridgeGap` + `recallBudgetOverflow`
    Each of the resulting eleven obligations has exactly one responsible
    mechanism, making removal-irredundancy provable. -/

/-! ## Residual-Risk Obligation Taxonomy and Removal Irredundancy -/

/-! ### ResidualRiskObligation — refined taxonomy for irredundancy

The `ResidualRiskMode` taxonomy has two modes with multiple mitigators:
- `unrevokedDefect` is covered by both `bankLifecycle` and `redeemability`
- `overbudgetReliance` is covered by both `trustBridge` and `boundedRecall`

Removal-irredundancy over `ResidualRiskMode` is not provable as stated because
removing one mitigator from a multi-covered mode still leaves the other.
The fix splits each overlapping mode at its `GroundedMitigates` seam — each
resulting obligation has exactly one responsible mechanism. -/

/-- Residual-risk obligations: the `ResidualRiskMode` taxonomy refined to
