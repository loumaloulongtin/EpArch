Convergence

The central convergence theorem and the full structural proof machinery:
any WorkingSystem that is StructurallyForced and satisfies all six
operational properties necessarily contains Bank primitives.

## Structure

1. `StructurallyForced` — forward-only forcing implications (capability → feature),
   each field independently justified by a structural model in Minimality.lean.
2. `ForcingEmbedding` — auditable disjunction connecting WorkingSystems to the abstract
   structural models; `embedding_to_structurally_forced` derives StructurallyForced
   constructively (no Classical reasoning).
3. Bridge predicates (`BridgeBubbles` … `BridgeRedeemability`) and
   `bridge_*_impossible` theorems — system-independent impossibility: committing to
   the impossible scenario for any dimension is universally False.
4. Six Scenario predicates (RepresentsDisagreement, RepresentsPrivateCoordination,
   RepresentsMonotonicLifecycle, RepresentsDiscriminatingImport,
   RepresentsBoundedVerification, RepresentsClosedEndorsement) — enriched
   WorkingSystem instantiations that let the abstract structural models fire
   on concrete systems.
5. `convergence_structural` — the central theorem:
   StructurallyForced W → SatisfiesAllProperties W → containsBankPrimitives W.
6. `structural_impossibility` — missing any feature blocks all-property satisfaction.

/-! ## StructurallyForced: Forward-Direction Forcing

`StructurallyForced` packages the six `handles_X → HasY` forcing implications
as a single universally-quantified field indexed by `Pressure`.  Pattern-matching
on `Pressure` is machine-exhaustive: if a new dimension is added, every `cases P`
proof requires a new case.

Each `handles_pressure W P → forced_feature W P` instance is independently
justified by a structural impossibility model in `Minimality.lean`. -/

    stored `GroundedXStrict` evidence.

    Separated from `StructurallyForced` so that the forcing interface and the
    evidence-readout bundle remain conceptually distinct.  When strict evidence
    is present the consequence is already carried by the value — these six fields
    simply expose it. -/

/-- A system is structurally forced: for every pressure dimension, handling
    the capability implies the forced architectural feature.

    `forcing` is the core convergence interface: the six unguarded
    capability→feature implications, derived from the `ForcingEmbedding`.

    `evidence` is the structural consequence bundle: impossibility proofs
    read directly from the system’s stored `GroundedXStrict` fields.  The two
    are logically independent — `forcing` is about implication chains;
    `evidence` is about what the stored proof objects already carry. -/

/-! ## Forcing Embeddings: Translation Layer

The structural models above prove clean no-go lemmas on abstract scenarios.
`StructurallyForced` packages the forward implications (capability → feature).
The remaining gap: the `StructurallyForced` fields are narratively "justified by"
the structural models but not mechanically derived from them.

`ForcingEmbedding` closes this gap.  Each field says:

> "A system handling capability X either already has feature Y, or it
>  embeds the abstract scenario whose impossibility is already proven."

The derivation `embedding_to_structurally_forced` is then a generic,
mechanical combination: for each direction, take the `Or`, and in the
right branch apply the structural impossibility theorem to produce `False`.
The left branch is the feature itself.

The proof chain becomes:

    ForcingEmbedding ──┐
                       ├── StructurallyForced ──► convergence_structural
    Structural models ─┘

The `ForcingEmbedding` instance encodes when a system without feature X
facing constraint Y is in the impossible scenario.  The derivation is
uniform and constructive (no Classical reasoning — `Or.elim` is intuitionistic). -/

/-! ## Bridge Predicates and System-Independent Forcing Theorems

A **bridge predicate** `Bridge_X W` names the commitment a system would
have to make in dimension X if it lacks feature X.  Each is an existential
over the abstract structural model's scenario data.

The `bridge_*_impossible` theorems are system-independent: for ANY `W`,
committing to the impossible scenario forces the feature.  They are
derived directly from the structural impossibility theorems — no
`StructurallyForced` or `convergence_structural` involved.

**Separation of concerns:**
- The concrete good system proves `StructurallyForced` via `ForcingEmbedding`
  (the full convergence pipeline, using `Or.inl` everywhere).
- Deficient systems prove `Bridge_X DeficientSystem → False` directly via
  `bridge_X_impossible`: the bridge commitment data is universally absurd.
  `SatisfiesAllProperties`, ¬HasFeature, and the convergence pipeline are
  not involved.

This matches what is actually proven: deficient systems + bridge hypothesis ⇒
contradiction, NOT deficient system alone ⇒ contradiction. -/

/-- Forcing embeddings: connects a `WorkingSystem` to the abstract
    structural models via an auditable disjunction, indexed by `Pressure`.

    The single field says: for every pressure dimension P, a system handling
    capability P either already has the forced feature, OR is bridge-committed
    to the impossible scenario for that dimension.  Since bridge commitment
    forces the feature (via `all_bridges_impossible`), the feature holds
    in both branches. -/
structure ForcingEmbedding (W : WorkingSystem) : Prop where
  /-- For every pressure dimension P, handling capability P either yields
      the forced feature or commits to the universally impossible scenario. -/
  embed : ∀ P : Pressure, handles_pressure W P →
    forced_feature W P ∨ bridge_scenario W P

/-- Mechanical derivation: `ForcingEmbedding` → `StructurallyForced`.

    The `forcing` field is derived by `Or.elim`: the left branch is the feature
    itself (`id`); the right branch applies `all_bridges_impossible P`, which
    proves `¬bridge_scenario W P` directly — so the right branch is universally
    absurd.  Fully constructive — no `Classical.byContradiction`.

    The `evidence` bundle reads proof terms directly from the stored
    `GroundedXStrict` evidence: each consequence is already carried by the
    value, so each field is `fun G _h_ev => G.consequence`.  `_h_ev` is named
    (not `_`) to acknowledge the discarded equality `W.*_ev = some G`; it is
    structurally redundant here because any `G : GroundedXStrict` self-certifies
    the consequence by type.  For pinned-evidence proofs that use the stored
    witness identity, see `concrete_structurally_forced` and
    `grounded_evidence_consequences`. -/

/-! ## Scenario Predicates: Enriching WorkingSystems with Structural Content

The structural models prove impossibility on abstract scenarios.
The `ForcingEmbedding` connects these to working systems via disjunctions.
For a system that already has all features (like `ConcreteWorkingSystem`),
`Or.inl` suffices — but the abstract models never fire.

Scenario predicates supply the concrete data needed to instantiate the
abstract structural models.  When a system has a scenario predicate and
lacks the corresponding feature, a right-branch embedding theorem proves
the system instantiates the impossible scenario — and the structural model fires. -/


/-! ### Scenario 1: Distributed Disagreement -/

/-- A system represents distributed disagreement if it carries two
    acceptance predicates over some claim type that genuinely disagree:
    agent 1 accepts a witness claim that agent 2 rejects.

    When such a system lacks bubbles, it is in the `AgentDisagreement`
    scenario: a single flat scope must represent both acceptance profiles
    simultaneously — which `flat_scope_impossible` proves impossible.

    This is not a hypothetical: any system that claims to "handle
    distributed agents" must accommodate disagreeing acceptance criteria
    (otherwise there's no distributed agency to handle). -/
structure RepresentsDisagreement (W : WorkingSystem) where
  /-- The claim type the agents reason over. -/
  Claim : Type
  /-- Agent 1's acceptance criterion. -/
  accept₁ : Claim → Prop
  /-- Agent 2's acceptance criterion. -/
  accept₂ : Claim → Prop
  /-- Witness claim where they disagree. -/
  witness : Claim
  /-- Agent 1 accepts the witness. -/
  agent1_accepts : accept₁ witness
  /-- Agent 2 rejects the witness. -/
  agent2_rejects : ¬accept₂ witness

/-- Extract the `AgentDisagreement` abstract model from a system that
    `RepresentsDisagreement`. -/
def RepresentsDisagreement.toDisagreement {W : WorkingSystem}
    (R : RepresentsDisagreement W) : AgentDisagreement where
  Claim := R.Claim
  accept₁ := R.accept₁
  accept₂ := R.accept₂
  witness := R.witness
  agent1_accepts := R.agent1_accepts
  agent2_rejects := R.agent2_rejects

/-- **Right-branch embedding (scope direction).**

    A system that represents distributed disagreement and lacks bubbles
    yields the `AgentDisagreement` scenario.  In a flat (single-scope) system
    the acceptance function must agree with both agents — but
    `flat_scope_impossible` proves this is contradictory.

    The hypothesis `flat_accept` is the bridge condition: without scope
    separation, the system commits to a single acceptance predicate that
    purports to faithfully represent both agents.  The right branch of
    `disagreement_scope_embed` is then constructible, and
    `embedding_to_structurally_forced` closes it via `flat_scope_impossible`.

    This theorem demonstrates the abstract model doing real work: the
    structural lemma is used essentially here. -/

/-- **Per-dimension structural forcing (scope).**

/-! ### Scenario 2: Private-Only Coordination -/

/-- A system represents private-only coordination if it carries
    evidence that its storage layer, absent a shared ledger, isolates
    agents: deposits accessible to one agent are not accessible to the other.

    When such a system lacks a shared ledger (bank), it is in the
    `PrivateOnlyStorage` scenario: agents must share a deposit for
    coordination, but isolation prevents this — which
    `private_storage_no_sharing` proves impossible. -/

/-! ### Scenario 3: Monotonic Lifecycle (Adversarial → Revocation)

A system facing adversarial pressure has a deposit lifecycle.  If revocation
is absent, the "accepted" state is absorbing — once a deposit passes
acceptance, no transition can remove it.  `monotonic_no_exit` proves
(by induction) that an accepted deposit stays accepted through any
number of steps.

`RepresentsMonotonicLifecycle` enriches a `WorkingSystem` with a
concrete lifecycle (states, transition function, absorbing accepted state)
and an adversarial witness: a bad deposit that reaches the accepted state.
When `¬HasRevocation`, the system is in the `MonotonicLifecycle` scenario. -/

/-- A system represents a monotonic lifecycle if, absent revocation,
    its deposit lifecycle has an absorbing "accepted" state: once a
    deposit is accepted, no transition can remove it.

    state.  Without revocation, it stays there permanently. -/

/-! ### Scenario 4: Discriminating Import (Export → Headers)

When deposits cross scope boundaries, the receiver must decide which
to accept.  Without metadata (headers), every deposit looks identical
— the import function is uniform.  But sound-and-complete import
requires accepting good claims and rejecting bad ones.  A uniform
function cannot discriminate.

`RepresentsDiscriminatingImport` enriches a `WorkingSystem` with
two concrete claims (good and bad) that the import function must
distinguish.  When `¬HasHeaders`, the system is in the
`DiscriminatingImport` scenario. -/

/-- A system represents a discriminating import scenario if it faces
    two claims that must be distinguished on import: one should be
    accepted, one rejected.

    The structural point: without metadata (headers), claims are
    indistinguishable, so any import function is uniform.
    `no_sound_complete_uniform_import` proves that a uniform function
    cannot be both sound and complete — any proposed function either
    accepts the bad claim or rejects the good one.

    Whether a system's import function is ACTUALLY uniform (the bridge
    hypothesis) depends on the system and is carried as a separate hypothesis

/-! ### Scenario 5: Bounded Verification (Bounded Audit → Trust Bridges)

When full verification is costly, some claims exceed any fixed budget.
A verification-only import policy cannot handle those claims.

`RepresentsBoundedVerification` enriches a `WorkingSystem` with a
concrete claim universe where at least one claim exceeds the verification
budget.  When `¬HasTrustBridges`, the system is in the
`BoundedVerification` scenario. -/

/-- A system represents bounded verification if, absent trust bridges,
    it faces claims whose verification cost exceeds the budget.

    The `hard_claim_without_trust` field is the bridge condition: without
    trust-based import, the system must reverify every claim, but at
    least one claim exceeds the budget. -/

  /-- The claim type. -/
  Claim : Type

  exceeds_budget := R.exceeds_budget

/-- **Right-branch embedding (trust direction).**

    A system with bounded verification and no trust bridges:
    `verification_only_import_incomplete` fires via Nat arithmetic
    to prove that at least one claim cannot be reverified within
    budget. -/

/-! ### Scenario 6: Closed Endorsement (Truth Pressure → Redeemability)

In a closed endorsement system (no external constraint surface), the
only notion of truth is internal consensus.  Every endorsed claim is
true by definition — there is nothing external it could fail against.

`RepresentsClosedEndorsement` enriches a `WorkingSystem` with a
concrete claim, its endorsement, and evidence that the system is
closed absent redeemability.  When `¬HasRedeemability`, the system
is in the `ClosedEndorsement` scenario. -/

/-- A system represents a closed endorsement scenario if, absent
    redeemability, endorsed claims cannot be externally falsified.

    The `closed_without_redeemability` field is the bridge condition:
    without external constraint-surface contact, no endorsed claim
    is falsifiable. -/
structure RepresentsClosedEndorsement (W : WorkingSystem) where
  /-- The claim type. -/
  Claim : Type
  /-- Internal endorsement (consensus). -/

/-- **Right-branch embedding (truth pressure direction).**

    A system with closed endorsement and no redeemability:

    can be simultaneously falsifiable — contradicting truth pressure. -/

/-! ## Bundled Witness Packages

Two structures replace the 20+ loose parameters of the all-six forcing theorem
with named records, separated by the nature of the evidence they carry.

**`SystemOperationalBundle W`** — the three *architectural* dimensions:
scope disagreement, discriminating import, private coordination.  These are
purely operational/topological facts about the system.  They have no
world-semantic counterpart in `WorldCtx`.

**`WorldBridgeBundle W`** — the three *world-adjacent* dimensions:
monotonic lifecycle (revocation), bounded verification (trust), closed
endorsement (redeemability).  These correspond semantically to the W_* world
bundles, but the `Represents*` instances and their bridge hypotheses are
W-specific data that cannot be derived from W_* bundles alone.  A future
bridge layer may close that gap; for now they are supplied explicitly. -/

/-- Bundled witnesses for the three purely architectural dimensions:
    scope (disagreement), headers (discriminating import), bank (coordination).

    Each field group is: a `Represents*` structural witness followed by the
    per-dimension bridge hypothesis that makes the impossible scenario
    constructible when the corresponding feature is absent.

    None of these fields carry world-semantic content — they describe
    the system's operational topology independently of any `WorldCtx`. -/
structure SystemOperationalBundle (W : WorkingSystem) where
  /-- Scope dimension: a disagreement scenario witness. -/
  Rd          : RepresentsDisagreement W
  /-- Without bubbles, a flat acceptance function faithfully represents both agents. -/
  flat_accept : ¬HasBubbles W → Rd.Claim → Prop
  hflat₁      : ∀ h c, flat_accept h c ↔ Rd.accept₁ c
  hflat₂      : ∀ h c, flat_accept h c ↔ Rd.accept₂ c
  /-- Headers dimension: a discriminating import scenario witness. -/

  /-- Without headers, the import function is uniform. -/
  f_import    : ¬HasHeaders W → Ri.Claim → Bool
  h_unif      : ∀ h x y, f_import h x = f_import h y
  h_sound     : ∀ h, f_import h Ri.bad = false
  h_complete  : ∀ h, f_import h Ri.good = true
  /-- Bank dimension: a private coordination scenario witness. -/
  Rp             : RepresentsPrivateCoordination W
  /-- Without a shared ledger, both agents still access this deposit. -/
  shared_deposit : ¬HasBank W → Rp.Deposit
  h_access₁      : ∀ h, Rp.has_access Rp.a₁ (shared_deposit h)
  h_access₂      : ∀ h, Rp.has_access Rp.a₂ (shared_deposit h)

/-- Bundled witnesses for the three world-adjacent dimensions:
    revocation (adversarial/lies), trust (bounded verification),
    redeemability (truth pressure).

    These dimensions are semantically sourced by the EpArch W_* world bundles,
    but the structural scenario witnesses and their bridge hypotheses are
    W-specific: `RepresentsMonotonicLifecycle W`, `RepresentsBoundedVerification W`,
    and `RepresentsClosedEndorsement W` carry data about the concrete system `W`,
    not about the world context. -/
structure WorldBridgeBundle (W : WorkingSystem) where
  /-- Revocation dimension: a monotonic lifecycle scenario witness. -/

  /-- The step count at which the accepted state escapes absent revocation. -/
  n_rev        : Nat

  /-- Trust dimension: a bounded verification scenario witness. -/

/-! ## Convergence and Impossibility (Structural Versions) -/

/-- Convergence theorem (structural version): under structural forcing,
    any system satisfying all properties contains Bank primitives.

    The proof does **not** depend on assumed biconditionals — only on the
    forward-direction implications justified by the structural models. -/
theorem convergence_structural (W : WorkingSystem) (h_sf : StructurallyForced W) :
    SatisfiesAllProperties W → containsBankPrimitives W :=
  fun h_sat P => h_sf.forcing P (h_sat P)

/-- Structural impossibility: missing any feature blocks all-property satisfaction. -/
theorem structural_impossibility (W : WorkingSystem) (h_sf : StructurallyForced W) :
    (∃ P : Pressure, ¬forced_feature W P) → ¬SatisfiesAllProperties W :=
  fun ⟨P, h_miss⟩ h_sat => absurd (h_sf.forcing P (h_sat P)) h_miss

/-- Grounded evidence consequences: when a structurally forced system satisfies
    all properties, the stored `GroundedXStrict` witnesses are non-vacuously
    exercised.  This is the primary consumer of
    `StructurallyForced.evidence`: each dimension extracts its stored witness
    via the `SatisfiesAllProperties` `isSome` guarantee, then applies
    `h_sf.evidence.X_consequence` to it — making the `EvidenceConsequences`
    bundle genuinely load-bearing (Gap 1).

    The `none`-vacuity gap (Gap 3) is closed: `SatisfiesAllProperties W`
    forces each `*_ev` to be `some G`, so the universals in
    `EvidenceConsequences` are applied to an actual stored witness.
    The `none` branch is contradicted by `h_sat`. -/
