Convergence

The central convergence theorem and the full structural proof machinery:
any WorkingSystem that is StructurallyForced and satisfies all six
operational properties necessarily contains Bank primitives.

## Structure

1. `StructurallyForced` — forward-only forcing implications (capability → feature),
   each field independently justified by a structural model in Minimality.lean.
2. `wellformed_implies_structurally_forced` — forward-direction extraction from WellFormed.
3. `ForcingEmbedding` — auditable disjunction connecting WorkingSystems to the abstract
   structural models; `embedding_to_structurally_forced` derives StructurallyForced
   constructively (no Classical reasoning).
4. Bridge predicates (`BridgeBubbles` … `BridgeRedeemability`) and
   `bridge_*_impossible` theorems — system-independent impossibility: committing to
   the impossible scenario for any dimension is universally False.
5. Six Scenario predicates (RepresentsDisagreement, RepresentsPrivateCoordination,
   RepresentsMonotonicLifecycle, RepresentsDiscriminatingImport,
   RepresentsBoundedVerification, RepresentsClosedEndorsement) — enriched
   WorkingSystem instantiations that let the abstract structural models fire
   on concrete systems.
6. `convergence_structural` — the central theorem:
   StructurallyForced W → SatisfiesAllProperties W → containsBankPrimitives W.
7. `structural_impossibility` — missing any feature blocks all-property satisfaction.

/-! ## StructurallyForced: Forward-Direction Forcing Without WellFormed

`StructurallyForced` captures the same forward implications as `WellFormed`
but without the backward direction and without assuming biconditionals.

Where `WellFormed` assumes `handles_X ↔ HasY`, `StructurallyForced`
packages only the `handles_X → HasY` direction.  The structural models
above justify constructing these implications; the backward direction
(needed only for behavioral equivalence, not forcing) remains in
`WellFormed` for uses that require it.

Relationship to WellFormed:
- `WellFormed W → StructurallyForced W` (forward extraction, see below)
- `StructurallyForced` suffices for convergence and impossibility theorems
- `WellFormed` additionally enables `bank_primitives_determine_behavior`  -/

    the corresponding architectural feature.  Each field is independently

/-! ## Forcing Embeddings: Translation Layer

The structural models above prove clean no-go lemmas on abstract scenarios.
`StructurallyForced` packages the forward implications (capability → feature).
The remaining gap: the `StructurallyForced` fields are narratively "justified by"
the structural models but not mechanically derived from them.

`ForcingEmbedding` closes this gap.  Each field says:

> "A system handling capability X either already has feature Y, or it
>  embeds the abstract scenario whose impossibility is already proven."

The derivation `embedding_to_structurally_forced` is then a generic,
mechanical combination: for each direction, take the `Or`, and in the
right branch apply the structural impossibility theorem to produce `False`.
The left branch is the feature itself.

The proof chain becomes:

    ForcingEmbedding ──┐
                       ├── StructurallyForced ──► convergence_structural
    Structural models ─┘

The `ForcingEmbedding` instance encodes when a system without feature X
facing constraint Y is in the impossible scenario.  The derivation is
uniform and constructive (no Classical reasoning — `Or.elim` is intuitionistic). -/

/-! ## Bridge Predicates and System-Independent Forcing Theorems

A **bridge predicate** `Bridge_X W` names the commitment a system would
have to make in dimension X if it lacks feature X.  Each is an existential
over the abstract structural model's scenario data.

The `bridge_*_impossible` theorems are system-independent: for ANY `W`,
committing to the impossible scenario forces the feature.  They are
derived directly from the structural impossibility theorems — no
`StructurallyForced` or `convergence_structural` involved.

**Separation of concerns:**
- The concrete good system proves `StructurallyForced` via `ForcingEmbedding`
  (the full convergence pipeline, using `Or.inl` everywhere).
- Deficient systems prove `Bridge_X DeficientSystem → False` directly via
  `bridge_X_impossible`: the bridge commitment data is universally absurd.
  `SatisfiesAllProperties`, ¬HasFeature, and the convergence pipeline are
  not involved.

This matches what is actually proven: deficient systems + bridge hypothesis ⇒
contradiction, NOT deficient system alone ⇒ contradiction. -/

/-! ## Scenario Predicates: Enriching WorkingSystems with Structural Content

The structural models prove impossibility on abstract scenarios.
The `ForcingEmbedding` connects these to working systems via disjunctions.
For a system that already has all features (like `ConcreteWorkingSystem`),
`Or.inl` suffices — but the abstract models never fire.

Scenario predicates supply the concrete data needed to instantiate the
abstract structural models.  When a system has a scenario predicate and
lacks the corresponding feature, a right-branch embedding theorem proves
the system instantiates the impossible scenario — and the structural model fires. -/


/-! ### Scenario 1: Distributed Disagreement -/

/-- A system represents distributed disagreement if it carries two
    acceptance predicates over some claim type that genuinely disagree:
    agent 1 accepts a witness claim that agent 2 rejects.

    When such a system lacks bubbles, it is in the `AgentDisagreement`
    scenario: a single flat scope must represent both acceptance profiles
    simultaneously — which `flat_scope_impossible` proves impossible.

    This is not a hypothetical: any system that claims to "handle
    distributed agents" must accommodate disagreeing acceptance criteria
    (otherwise there's no distributed agency to handle). -/
structure RepresentsDisagreement (W : WorkingSystem) where
  /-- The claim type the agents reason over. -/
  Claim : Type
  /-- Agent 1's acceptance criterion. -/
  accept₁ : Claim → Prop
  /-- Agent 2's acceptance criterion. -/
  accept₂ : Claim → Prop
  /-- Witness claim where they disagree. -/
  witness : Claim
  /-- Agent 1 accepts the witness. -/
  agent1_accepts : accept₁ witness
  /-- Agent 2 rejects the witness. -/
  agent2_rejects : ¬accept₂ witness

/-- Extract the `AgentDisagreement` abstract model from a system that
    `RepresentsDisagreement`. -/
def RepresentsDisagreement.toDisagreement {W : WorkingSystem}
    (R : RepresentsDisagreement W) : AgentDisagreement where
  Claim := R.Claim
  accept₁ := R.accept₁
  accept₂ := R.accept₂
  witness := R.witness
  agent1_accepts := R.agent1_accepts
  agent2_rejects := R.agent2_rejects

/-- **Right-branch embedding (scope direction).**

    A system that represents distributed disagreement and lacks bubbles
    yields the `AgentDisagreement` scenario.  In a flat (single-scope) system
    the acceptance function must agree with both agents — but
    `flat_scope_impossible` proves this is contradictory.

    The hypothesis `flat_accept` is the bridge condition: without scope
    separation, the system commits to a single acceptance predicate that
    purports to faithfully represent both agents.  The right branch of
    `ForcingEmbedding.scope_embed` is then constructible, and
    `embedding_to_structurally_forced` closes it via `flat_scope_impossible`.

    This theorem demonstrates the abstract model doing real work: the
    structural lemma is used essentially here. -/

/-! ### Scenario 2: Private-Only Coordination -/

/-- A system represents private-only coordination if it carries
    evidence that its storage layer, absent a shared ledger, isolates
    agents: deposits accessible to one agent are not accessible to the other.

    When such a system lacks a shared ledger (bank), it is in the
    `PrivateOnlyStorage` scenario: agents must share a deposit for
    coordination, but isolation prevents this — which
    `private_storage_no_sharing` proves impossible. -/

  isolation := R.isolation_without_bank h_no_bank

/-- **Right-branch embedding (coordination direction).**

    A system that represents private-only coordination and lacks a bank
    yields the `PrivateOnlyStorage` scenario.  The system claims agents
    coordinate by sharing deposits, but storage is isolated —
    `private_storage_no_sharing` proves this is contradictory. -/

/-! ### Scenario 3: Monotonic Lifecycle (Adversarial → Revocation)

A system facing adversarial pressure has a deposit lifecycle.  If revocation
is absent, the "accepted" state is absorbing — once a deposit passes
acceptance, no transition can remove it.  `monotonic_no_exit` proves
(by induction) that an accepted deposit stays accepted through any
number of steps.

`RepresentsMonotonicLifecycle` enriches a `WorkingSystem` with a
concrete lifecycle (states, transition function, absorbing accepted state)
and an adversarial witness: a bad deposit that reaches the accepted state.
When `¬HasRevocation`, the system is in the `MonotonicLifecycle` scenario. -/

/-- A system represents a monotonic lifecycle if, absent revocation,
    its deposit lifecycle has an absorbing "accepted" state: once a
    deposit is accepted, no transition can remove it.

    The `bad_deposit_accepted` field is the adversarial witness:
    a deposit that should not be accepted but reaches the accepted
    state.  Without revocation, it stays there permanently. -/

  /-- The lifecycle state type. -/
  State : Type

/-- **Right-branch embedding (adversarial direction).**

    A system with a monotonic lifecycle and no revocation:
    `monotonic_no_exit` fires by induction, proving that the accepted
    state cannot be escaped at any step count `n`.  This is the
    strongest proof in the repo — genuine induction, not just
    hypothesis contradiction. -/

    iter R.step n R.accepted = R.accepted :=
  monotonic_no_exit (R.toLifecycle h_no_rev) n


/-! ### Scenario 4: Discriminating Import (Export → Headers)

When deposits cross scope boundaries, the receiver must decide which
to accept.  Without metadata (headers), every deposit looks identical
— the import function is uniform.  But sound-and-complete import
requires accepting good claims and rejecting bad ones.  A uniform
function cannot discriminate.

`RepresentsDiscriminatingImport` enriches a `WorkingSystem` with
two concrete claims (good and bad) that the import function must
distinguish.  When `¬HasHeaders`, the system is in the
`DiscriminatingImport` scenario. -/

/-- A system represents a discriminating import scenario if it faces
    two claims that must be distinguished on import: one should be
    accepted, one rejected.

    The structural point: without metadata (headers), claims are
    indistinguishable, so any import function is uniform.
    `no_sound_complete_uniform_import` proves that a uniform function
    cannot be both sound and complete — any proposed function either
    accepts the bad claim or rejects the good one.

    Whether a system's import function is ACTUALLY uniform (the bridge
    hypothesis) depends on the system and is carried as a separate hypothesis
    in the right-branch embedding theorems. -/
structure RepresentsDiscriminatingImport (W : WorkingSystem) where
  /-- The claim type crossing scope boundaries. -/
  Claim : Type
  /-- A claim the receiver should accept. -/
  good : Claim
  /-- A claim the receiver should reject. -/
  bad : Claim
  /-- The claims are distinct. -/
  good_ne_bad : good ≠ bad

/-- Extract `DiscriminatingImport` from a system that
    `RepresentsDiscriminatingImport`. -/

    (R : RepresentsDiscriminatingImport W) : DiscriminatingImport where
  Claim := R.Claim
  good := R.good
  bad := R.bad
  good_ne_bad := R.good_ne_bad

/-- **Right-branch embedding (export direction).**

    A system with discriminating import needs and no headers:
    any import function `f` must satisfy `f good = true` and
    `f bad = false` for sound-and-complete import.  The bridge hypothesis
    (`h_uniform`) says that without headers,
    the import function is uniform: `f x = f y` for all `x y`.
    `no_sound_complete_uniform_import` fires via `Bool.noConfusion`
    to derive False. -/

    False :=
  no_sound_complete_uniform_import R.toImport f h_uniform h_sound h_complete


/-! ### Scenario 5: Bounded Verification (Bounded Audit → Trust Bridges)

When full verification is costly, some claims exceed any fixed budget.
A verification-only import policy cannot handle those claims.

`RepresentsBoundedVerification` enriches a `WorkingSystem` with a
concrete claim universe where at least one claim exceeds the verification
budget.  When `¬HasTrustBridges`, the system is in the
`BoundedVerification` scenario. -/

/-- A system represents bounded verification if, absent trust bridges,
    it faces claims whose verification cost exceeds the budget.

    The `hard_claim_without_trust` field is the bridge condition: without
    trust-based import, the system must reverify every claim, but at
    least one claim exceeds the budget. -/
structure RepresentsBoundedVerification (W : WorkingSystem) where
  /-- The claim type. -/
  Claim : Type
  /-- Cost to fully verify a claim. -/

  /-- Maximum verification budget per import. -/
  budget : Nat
  /-- A claim that exceeds the budget. -/

/-- **Right-branch embedding (trust direction).**

    A system with bounded verification and no trust bridges:
    `verification_only_import_incomplete` fires via Nat arithmetic
    to prove that at least one claim cannot be reverified within
    budget. -/

  verification_only_import_incomplete R.toVerification h_all_within


/-! ### Scenario 6: Closed Endorsement (Truth Pressure → Redeemability)

In a closed endorsement system (no external constraint surface), the
only notion of truth is internal consensus.  Every endorsed claim is
true by definition — there is nothing external it could fail against.

`RepresentsClosedEndorsement` enriches a `WorkingSystem` with a
concrete claim, its endorsement, and evidence that the system is
closed absent redeemability.  When `¬HasRedeemability`, the system
is in the `ClosedEndorsement` scenario. -/

/-- A system represents a closed endorsement scenario if, absent
    redeemability, endorsed claims cannot be externally falsified.

    The `closed_without_redeemability` field is the bridge condition:
    without external constraint-surface contact, no endorsed claim
    is falsifiable. -/

  /-- The claim type. -/

    A system with closed endorsement and no redeemability:
    `closed_system_unfalsifiable` fires to prove no endorsed claim
    can be simultaneously falsifiable — contradicting truth pressure. -/

/-! ## Convergence and Impossibility (Structural Versions) -/

/-- Convergence theorem (structural version): under structural forcing,
    any system satisfying all properties contains Bank primitives.

    This is the preferred convergence statement.  Unlike the WellFormed-
    extraction path (via `wellformed_implies_structurally_forced`), this
    theorem does **not** depend on assumed biconditionals — only on the
    forward-direction implications justified by the structural models. -/
