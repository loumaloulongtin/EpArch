EpArch/Feasibility.lean — Existence Under Constraints / Non-Vacuity Theorems

This module packages existing witnesses into "system class is nonempty"
statements, providing non-vacuity and existence proofs for
the existence-under-constraints claim.

## Purpose

Natural objections to an epistemic systems framework:
- "Are these constraints even consistent? Maybe they're vacuous."
- "Does a system satisfying these properties actually exist?"

This module answers: Yes. The constraint bundles are satisfiable,
working systems exist, and success forces Bank primitives.

## Headline Theorems

- `structural_goals_force_bank_primitives`: StructurallyForced ∧ SatisfiesAllProperties → containsBankPrimitives
- `existence_under_constraints_structural`: ∃ W, StructurallyForced W ∧ SatisfiesAllProperties W ∧ containsBankPrimitives W
- `bundled_structure_forces_bank_primitives`: uses SystemOperationalBundle + WorldBridgeBundle

These package non-vacuity + forced primitives into citable results.

## Claim Budget

**Buys:**
- "The constraint+objective package is consistent (nonempty)"
- "There exists at least one working system meeting the success bundle"
- "Success forces Bank primitives" (via Minimality)

**Does NOT buy:**
- "The real world literally is this model"
- "Uniqueness" (many realizations can exist)
- "Abduction/inference from observed O to existence of S"

/-! ## World-to-Structural Bridges

These theorems connect the W_* world assumption bundles (WorldCtx.lean) to the
structural impossibility models (Minimality.lean).  Previously the two sides were
proved independently — the structural models had hand-supplied witnesses, and the
world assumptions had witnesses of their own.  These bridges show that any world
satisfying a W_* bundle supplies enough data to construct a matching structural
scenario instance, so the forcing results apply without a separate construction step.

The constructed instances are the minimal form sufficient to trigger the relevant
impossibility theorem — they package the W bundle's witness values, not a full
semantic import of the world's relational structure. -/

/-- Any world satisfying W_bounded_verification constructs a `BoundedVerification`
    instance sufficient to trigger `verification_only_import_incomplete`.

    The W bundle supplies a hard claim P and step count k > 0.  The constructed M
    packages these into the minimal abstract form: `verify_cost := fun _ => k`
    (a constant, not C.RequiresSteps itself) and `budget := 0`.  The world's
    RequiresSteps field is preserved in the existential witness but is not carried
    into M's cost function.

    The constructed M has:
    - M.Claim = C.Claim  (claim type is the world's claim type, not Unit)
    - M.hard_claim = P   (the actual hard claim from the world assumption)
    - M.verify_cost P = k (the extracted step count, as a constant function)
    - ∀ w, C.RequiresSteps w P k  (world witness, returned alongside M)

    verification_only_import_incomplete then fires on M.
    Consequence: the incompleteness is specifically about the claim P the world
    says is hard — not a synthetic Unit witness. -/
theorem w_bounded_forces_incompleteness (C : @EpArch.WorldCtx.{0})
    (W : C.W_bounded_verification) :
    ∃ (P : C.Claim) (k : Nat) (M : BoundedVerification),
      k > 0 ∧
      (∀ w, C.RequiresSteps w P k) ∧
      M.Claim = C.Claim ∧
      ¬∀ c : M.Claim, M.verify_cost c ≤ M.budget := by
  have ⟨P, k, h_pos, h_req⟩ := W.verification_has_cost

/-- Any world satisfying W_lies_possible contains a false claim that is permanently
    trapped in every revocation-free lifecycle over that world's claim type.

    For any step function where every false claim is absorbing, the same false claim
    supplied by W is injectable by every agent (W.unrestricted_utterance) and
    indelible under that step function (monotonic_no_exit).

    The schema parameters `step` and `h_absorb` are universally quantified in the
    conclusion: the result holds for all candidate revocation-free lifecycles, not
    just a specific one supplied as a hypothesis. -/

/-- Any world satisfying W_partial_observability has a claim that cannot be endorsed
    by any obs-stable closed endorsement system.

    For any endorsement predicate that is obs-stable (same observations → same
    endorsement) and closed (endorsed → true), the underdetermined claim from W
    cannot be endorsed in some world.

    The schema parameters `endorsed`, `obs_stable`, and `closed` are universally
    quantified in the conclusion: the result holds for all candidate closed
    endorsement systems, not just a specific one supplied as a hypothesis. -/

/-! ## World-Grounded Convergence -/

/-- A working system is world-aware with respect to WorldCtx C if its structural
    forcing implications are grounded in C's world assumptions (for those that
    have W_* bundle counterparts) and by structural analysis (for the rest).

    Three of the six StructurallyForced implications are justified by W_* bundles:
    - trust_forcing        ← W_bounded_verification (verification_only_import_incomplete)
    - revocation_forcing   ← W_lies_possible        (monotonic_no_exit)
    - redeemability_forcing ← W_partial_observability (closed_system_unfalsifiable)

    Three are justified by structural impossibility arguments alone and have no
    W_* bundle counterpart (AgentDisagreement, DiscriminatingImport,
    PrivateOnlyStorage) — included here as unconditional hypotheses. -/
def WorldAwareSystem (C : @EpArch.WorldCtx.{0}) (W : WorkingSystem) : Prop :=
  (C.W_bounded_verification  → handles_bounded_audit W    → HasTrustBridges W)  ∧
  (C.W_lies_possible         → handles_adversarial W      → HasRevocation W)    ∧
  (C.W_partial_observability → handles_truth_pressure W   → HasRedeemability W) ∧
  (handles_distributed_agents W → HasBubbles W) ∧
  (handles_export W             → HasHeaders W)  ∧
  (handles_coordination W       → HasBank W)

/-- A working system satisfying WorldAwareSystem and SatisfiesAllProperties,
    in a world satisfying all three W_* bundles, necessarily contains Bank primitives.

    WorldAwareSystem holds the structural work: it contains the three
    world-conditional capability→feature implications (trust, revocation,
    redeemability) plus the three unconditional ones.  The W_* bundles discharge
    the world-bundle guards in WorldAwareSystem; convergence_structural then
    closes the proof from StructurallyForced + SatisfiesAllProperties.

    All three W_* bundles are consumed: removing any one leaves the corresponding
    guard in WorldAwareSystem undischarged. -/

/-- Any StructurallyForced system satisfies WorldAwareSystem for any WorldCtx.

    Proof by weakening: StructurallyForced asserts all six capability→feature
    implications *unconditionally*, while WorldAwareSystem only requires three of
    them *conditionally* (behind W_* hypothesis guards).  Ignoring the W_* guard
    via `fun _ =>` discharges each conditional, reducing WorldAwareSystem to a
    strict weakening of StructurallyForced. -/

/-- Zero-hypothesis corollary: the concrete working system contains Bank primitives
    with no free assumptions.

    Proof path:
    (1) WitnessCtx (WorldWitness.lean) witnesses all three W_* bundles.
    (2) concrete_structurally_forced gives StructurallyForced ConcreteWorkingSystem.
    (3) structurally_forced_is_world_aware converts that to WorldAwareSystem WitnessCtx.
    (4) concrete_satisfies_all_properties gives SatisfiesAllProperties.
    (5) world_assumptions_force_bank_primitives closes the proof.

    The three world assumptions that appear as hypotheses in
    world_assumptions_force_bank_primitives are discharged here by the WitnessCtx
    model, leaving a fully closed theorem. -/

/-- Any working system that carries explicit structural-scenario witnesses for all
    six EpArch dimensions and satisfies all operational properties necessarily
    contains Bank primitives.

    This theorem replaces `world_assumptions_force_bank_primitives` + `WorldAwareSystem`
    as the headline convergence result.  `WorldAwareSystem` bundles the six
    capability→feature implications as opaque Prop conjuncts; here each implication
    is unpacked into a named `Represents*` structure (structural data) plus an
    auditable bridge hypothesis (per-dimension forcing evidence):

    | Dimension     | Structure                        | Bridge hypothesis                                    |
    |---------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
    | Scope         | `RepresentsDisagreement`         | flat acceptance function matches both agents         |
    | Trust         | `RepresentsBoundedVerification`  | absent trust, all claims fit within budget           |
    | Headers       | `RepresentsDiscriminatingImport` | absent headers, import is uniform, sound, complete   |
    | Revocation    | `RepresentsMonotonicLifecycle`   | absent revocation, accepted state escapes at n_rev   |
    | Bank          | `RepresentsPrivateCoordination`  | absent ledger, both agents access the same deposit   |
    | Redeemability | `RepresentsClosedEndorsement`    | absent redeemability, endorsed claim is falsifiable  |

    All six `ForcingEmbedding` fields are constructed inline from the witnesses —
    none are stated as opaque system-design axioms.  `embedding_to_structurally_forced`
    and `convergence_structural` then close the proof mechanically. -/

/-- **Headline convergence theorem — bundled form.**

    Any working system carrying an `SystemOperationalBundle` (architectural
    witnesses for scope, headers, bank) and a `WorldBridgeBundle` (world-adjacent
    witnesses for revocation, trust, redeemability), satisfying all operational
    properties, necessarily contains Bank primitives.

    This is the cleanest citable form of the main result.  All 20+ per-dimension
    parameters from `grounded_world_and_structure_force_bank_primitives` are
    absorbed into two named records, symmetrically split by the nature of the
    evidence each carries:

    | Bundle                   | Dimensions                           |
    |--------------------------|--------------------------------------|
    | `SystemOperationalBundle`| scope · headers · bank               |
    | `WorldBridgeBundle`      | revocation · trust · redeemability   |

    **World-agnostic status:** No `WorldCtx` or W_* bundle appears in this
    signature.  The theorem's statement is world-agnostic — no formal world
    precondition is required.  The W_*
    bundles (W_lies_possible, W_bounded_verification, W_partial_observability)
    that characterise the EpArch world semantics are the natural *sources*
    for the `WorldBridgeBundle` data, but they are not formal preconditions
    here — the structural and operational witnesses alone suffice.

    Proof: one-liner unpack of both bundles into
    `grounded_world_and_structure_force_bank_primitives`. -/
