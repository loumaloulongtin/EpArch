EpArch.WorldBridges — World-to-Structural Bridge Theorems

Connects the W_* world assumption bundles (EpArch.WorldCtx) to the structural
impossibility models (EpArch.Minimality) and the Represents* scenario witnesses
(EpArch.Scenarios).  These are the load-bearing convergence results that sit
above the abstract structural machinery and below the concrete witnesses.

## Headline Theorems

- `grounded_world_and_structure_force_bank_primitives`: the full 20-parameter
  convergence theorem — uses six Represents* witnesses plus per-dimension bridge
  hypotheses to constructively derive containsBankPrimitives.
- `bundled_structure_forces_bank_primitives`: the packaged 4-argument form
  using SystemOperationalBundle + WorldBridgeBundle.
- `world_assumptions_force_bank_primitives`: world-conditional variant using
  WorldCtx W_* bundles directly.
- `kernel_world_forces_bank_primitives`: zero-hypothesis corollary.

/-! ## World-to-Structural Bridges

These theorems connect the W_* world assumption bundles (EpArch.WorldCtx) to the
structural impossibility models (EpArch.Minimality).  Each bridge shows that any world
satisfying a W_* bundle supplies enough data to construct a matching structural
scenario instance, so the forcing results apply without a separate construction step. -/

/-- Any world satisfying W_bounded_verification constructs a `BoundedVerification`
    instance sufficient to trigger `verification_only_import_incomplete`.

    Packages W's hard claim P and step count k into a minimal `BoundedVerification`
    with constant cost function.  The existential witnesses M, P, and k are returned
    alongside the world's own `RequiresSteps` evidence. -/
theorem w_bounded_forces_incompleteness (C : @EpArch.WorldCtx.{0})
    (W : C.W_bounded_verification) :
    ∃ (P : C.Claim) (k : Nat) (M : BoundedVerification),
      k > 0 ∧
      (∀ w, C.RequiresSteps w P k) ∧
      M.Claim = C.Claim ∧
      ¬∀ c : M.Claim, M.verify_cost c ≤ M.budget := by
  have ⟨P, k, h_pos, h_req⟩ := W.verification_has_cost
  let M : BoundedVerification := ⟨C.Claim, fun _ => k, 0, P, h_pos⟩
  exact ⟨P, k, M, h_pos, h_req, rfl, verification_only_import_incomplete M⟩

/-- Any world satisfying W_lies_possible contains a false claim that is permanently
    trapped in every revocation-free lifecycle over that world's claim type.

    For any step function where every false claim is absorbing, the same false claim
    supplied by W is injectable by every agent (W.unrestricted_utterance) and
    indelible under that step function (monotonic_no_exit).

    The schema parameters `step` and `h_absorb` are universally quantified in the
    conclusion: the result holds for all candidate revocation-free lifecycles, not
    just a specific one supplied as a hypothesis. -/
theorem w_lies_forces_revocation_need (C : @EpArch.WorldCtx.{0})
    (W : C.W_lies_possible) :
    ∃ w P, ¬C.Truth w P ∧ (∀ a, C.Utter a P) ∧
      ∀ (step : C.Claim → C.Claim),
        (∀ w' P', ¬C.Truth w' P' → step P' = P') →

  exact ⟨w, P, h_false, fun a => W.unrestricted_utterance a P,
    fun step h_absorb => monotonic_no_exit ⟨C.Claim, P, step, h_absorb w P h_false⟩⟩

/-- Any world satisfying W_partial_observability has a claim that cannot be endorsed
    by any obs-stable closed endorsement system.

    For any endorsement predicate that is obs-stable (same observations → same
    endorsement) and closed (endorsed → true), the underdetermined claim from W
    cannot be endorsed in some world.

    The schema parameters `endorsed`, `obs_stable`, and `closed` are universally
    quantified in the conclusion: the result holds for all candidate closed
    endorsement systems, not just a specific one supplied as a hypothesis. -/
theorem w_partial_obs_forces_redeemability (C : @EpArch.WorldCtx.{0})
    (W : C.W_partial_observability) :
    ∃ P w0,
      ∀ (endorsed : C.World → C.Claim → Prop),
        (∀ P' w0' w1', C.PartialObs w0' w1' → endorsed w0' P' → endorsed w1' P') →
        (∀ w P', endorsed w P' → C.Truth w P') →

  exact ⟨P, w0, fun endorsed obs_stable closed h_end =>
    (h_bic.mp (closed w0 P h_end)) (closed w1 P (obs_stable P w0 w1 h_obs h_end))⟩

/-- W_multi_agent_heterogeneous witnesses a non-trivially restricted authorization surface.

    The `secrets_exist` field directly supplies (a, P) where `¬Utter a P` — an agent
    that cannot assert some claim.  This is the formal basis for why open-mode ACL
    (acl_table = [], all agents authorized) is insufficient: at least one agent must be
    excluded from at least one claim's certification path. -/
theorem w_multi_agent_forces_authorization_need (C : @EpArch.WorldCtx.{0})
    (W : C.W_multi_agent_heterogeneous) :
    ∃ (a : C.Agent) (P : C.Claim), ¬C.Utter a P :=
  W.secrets_exist

/-- W_lies_possible and W_multi_agent_heterogeneous are incompatible.

    W_lies_possible.unrestricted_utterance asserts every agent can utter every claim.
    W_multi_agent_heterogeneous.secrets_exist asserts some agent cannot utter some claim.
    These are direct contradictions.

    Architectural consequence: a world under full adversarial pressure (W_lies_possible,
    unrestricted submission) cannot simultaneously protect secrets (W_multi_agent_heterogeneous).
    Equivalently, to protect secrets, the authorization surface must be gated — open-mode
    ACL is only sound when secrets are not a requirement. -/
theorem w_lies_multi_agent_incompatible (C : @EpArch.WorldCtx.{0})
    (W_lies : C.W_lies_possible)

/-! ## World-Grounded Convergence -/

/-- A working system is world-aware with respect to WorldCtx C if its structural
    forcing implications are grounded in C's world assumptions (for those that
    have W_* bundle counterparts) and by structural analysis (for the rest).

    Three of the six StructurallyForced implications are justified by W_* bundles:
    - trust_forcing        ← W_bounded_verification (verification_only_import_incomplete)
    - revocation_forcing   ← W_lies_possible        (monotonic_no_exit)
    - redeemability_forcing ← W_partial_observability (closed_system_unfalsifiable)

    Four are justified by structural impossibility arguments alone and have no
    W_* bundle counterpart (AgentDisagreement, DiscriminatingImport,
    PrivateOnlyStorage, UniformAccess) — included here as unconditional hypotheses. -/
def WorldAwareSystem (C : @EpArch.WorldCtx.{0}) (W : WorkingSystem) : Prop :=
  (C.W_bounded_verification  → handles_bounded_audit W    → HasTrustBridges W)  ∧

  (handles_coordination W       → HasBank W) ∧
  (handles_multi_agent W        → HasGranularACL W)

/-- A working system satisfying WorldAwareSystem and SatisfiesAllProperties,
    in a world satisfying all three W_* bundles, necessarily contains Bank primitives.

    WorldAwareSystem holds the structural work: it contains the three
    world-conditional capability→feature implications (trust, revocation,
    redeemability) plus the three unconditional ones.  The W_* bundles discharge
    the world-bundle guards in WorldAwareSystem; convergence_structural then
    closes the proof from StructurallyForced + SatisfiesAllProperties.

    All three W_* bundles are consumed: removing any one leaves the corresponding
    guard in WorldAwareSystem undischarged. -/

/-- Any StructurallyForced system satisfies WorldAwareSystem for any WorldCtx.

    Proof by weakening: StructurallyForced asserts all six capability→feature
    implications *unconditionally*, while WorldAwareSystem only requires three of
    them *conditionally* (behind W_* hypothesis guards).  Ignoring the W_* guard
    via `fun _ =>` discharges each conditional, reducing WorldAwareSystem to a
    strict weakening of StructurallyForced. -/

/-- Zero-hypothesis corollary: the concrete working system contains Bank primitives
    with no free assumptions.

    Proof path:
    (1) WitnessCtx (EpArch.WorldWitness) witnesses all three W_* bundles.
    (2) concrete_structurally_forced gives StructurallyForced ConcreteWorkingSystem.
    (3) structurally_forced_is_world_aware converts that to WorldAwareSystem WitnessCtx.
    (4) concrete_satisfies_all_properties gives SatisfiesAllProperties.
    (5) world_assumptions_force_bank_primitives closes the proof.

    The three world assumptions that appear as hypotheses in
    world_assumptions_force_bank_primitives are discharged here by the WitnessCtx
    model, leaving a fully closed theorem. -/

/-- Any working system that carries explicit structural-scenario witnesses for all
    six EpArch dimensions and satisfies all operational properties necessarily
    contains Bank primitives.

    This theorem replaces `world_assumptions_force_bank_primitives` + `WorldAwareSystem`
    as the headline convergence result.  `WorldAwareSystem` bundles the six
    capability→feature implications as opaque Prop conjuncts; here each implication
    is unpacked into a named `Represents*` structure (structural data) plus an
    auditable bridge hypothesis (per-dimension forcing evidence):

    | Dimension     | Structure                        | Bridge hypothesis                                    |
    |---------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
    | Scope         | `RepresentsDisagreement`         | flat acceptance function matches both agents         |
    | Trust         | `RepresentsBoundedVerification`  | absent trust, all claims fit within budget           |
    | Headers       | `RepresentsDiscriminatingImport` | absent headers, import is uniform, sound, complete   |
    | Revocation    | `RepresentsMonotonicLifecycle`   | absent revocation, accepted state escapes at n_rev   |
    | Bank          | `RepresentsPrivateCoordination`  | absent ledger, both agents access the same deposit   |
    | Redeemability | `RepresentsClosedEndorsement`    | absent redeemability, endorsed claim is falsifiable  |

    All six `ForcingEmbedding` fields are constructed inline from the witnesses —
    none are stated as opaque system-design axioms.  `embedding_to_structurally_forced`
    and `convergence_structural` then close the proof mechanically. -/

/-- **Headline convergence theorem — bundled form.**

    Any working system carrying an `SystemOperationalBundle` (architectural
    witnesses for scope, headers, bank) and a `WorldBridgeBundle` (world-adjacent
    witnesses for revocation, trust, redeemability), satisfying all operational
    properties, necessarily contains Bank primitives.

    This is the cleanest citable form of the main result.  All 20+ per-dimension
    parameters from `grounded_world_and_structure_force_bank_primitives` are
    absorbed into two named records, symmetrically split by the nature of the
    evidence each carries:

    | Bundle                   | Dimensions                                    |
    |--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
    | `SystemOperationalBundle`| scope · headers · bank · authorization        |
    | `WorldBridgeBundle`      | revocation · trust · redeemability            |

    **World-agnostic status:** No `WorldCtx` or W_* bundle appears in this
    signature.  The theorem's statement is world-agnostic — no formal world
    precondition is required.  The W_*
    bundles (W_lies_possible, W_bounded_verification, W_partial_observability)
    that characterise the EpArch world semantics are the natural *sources*
    for the `WorldBridgeBundle` data, but they are not formal preconditions
    here — the structural and operational witnesses alone suffice.

    Proof: one-liner unpack of both bundles into
    `grounded_world_and_structure_force_bank_primitives`. -/
