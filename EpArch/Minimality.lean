EpArch.Minimality — Minimality and Impossibility Theorems

Structural impossibility models: remove primitive X and constraint Y
cannot be satisfied. The convergence theorem itself
(convergence_structural) lives in EpArch.Convergence.

The core claim is convergence under constraints, not metaphysical necessity.
Any working solution must contain these structural elements, but
implementations can differ.

/-! ## Working System Abstraction -/

/-- A "working system" that coordinates under uncertainty.

    This abstracts over any system that successfully enables coordination
    while handling the constraints above. Such systems converge on
    Bank-like primitives. -/

/-! ## Forced Feature Predicates

These are definitional predicates that inspect the WorkingSystem's
SystemSpec to determine if features are present. Each predicate
corresponds to one "What It Forces" entry in the constraints table. -/

/-- Predicate: system has trust bridges (import-via-trust without full revalidation).

/-! ## Pressure: The Canonical Dimension Index

`Pressure` is the machine-exhaustive index of EpArch's eight architectural
forcing dimensions.  Using it as the canonical index for `handles_pressure`,
`forced_feature`, `SatisfiesAllProperties`, and `containsBankPrimitives`
means the coverage of the framework — exactly these eight and no others —
is a typed fact, not a counting convention.

A proof that pattern-matches on `Pressure` is checked by Lean for
exhaustiveness: adding a ninth dimension requires adding a ninth
constructor here, which would break every existing `cases P` proof
until the new forcing chain is supplied. -/

/-! ## Constraint Subset and Partial Well-Formedness -/

/-- A subset of the eight EpArch operational constraints, represented as an

    Examples:
    - `allConstraints`  — all eight included (strongest case)
    - `noConstraints`   — none included (no forcing theorems claimed)
    - `⟨true, false, false, false, true, false, false, false⟩` — only distributed + coordination -/

  distributed    : Bool
  bounded_audit  : Bool
  export_across  : Bool
  adversarial    : Bool
  coordination   : Bool
  truth_pressure : Bool
  multi_agent    : Bool

    For each constraint X:
    - If `S.X = true`,  the biconditional `handles_X W ↔ HasFeature_X W` is required.
    - If `S.X = false`, nothing is required for X.

/-! ## Grounded Behavioral Evidence

The eight capability witnesses correspond exactly to the eight `GroundedX` structures:

/-! ========================================================================
    Structural Forcing Models
    ========================================================================

This section provides **independent, structurally-grounded proofs** for
each forcing direction.  Each model captures the essential structure of
one constraint scenario and proves an impossibility or invariance result
from that structure alone — no biconditionals needed.

### Summary

| # | Constraint | Model | Theorem | Content |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Distributed agents | `AgentDisagreement` | `flat_scope_impossible` | Single scope can't represent disagreeing agents |
| 2 | Bounded audit | `BoundedVerification` | `verification_only_import_incomplete` | Verification-only import can't handle all claims |
| 3 | Export | `DiscriminatingImport` | `uniform_import_nondiscriminating` | Without metadata, import can't distinguish claims |
| 4 | Adversarial | `MonotonicLifecycle` | `monotonic_no_exit` | Without revocation, accepted state is absorbing |
| 5 | Coordination | `PrivateOnlyStorage` | `private_storage_no_sharing` | Isolated storage blocks collective reliance |
| 6 | Truth pressure | `ClosedEndorsement` | `closed_system_unfalsifiable` | Without external contact, consensus is unfalsifiable |
| 7 | Authorization | `TwoTierAccess` | `flat_authorization_impossible` | No flat predicate can represent both the submission and commit tiers |
| 8 | Bounded storage | `BoundedStorage` | `monotone_active_accumulation_overflows` | No fixed budget covers all active-deposit states; management is forced |

After the eight models, the convergence proof machinery (`StructurallyForced`,
`ForcingEmbedding`, Bridge predicates, Scenario predicates,
`convergence_structural`) lives in EpArch.Convergence.

/-! ### 1. Distributed Agents → Scope Separation (Bubbles)

**Argument.**  If two agents have genuinely different acceptance criteria,
no single flat acceptance function can faithfully represent both.  The
system must partition into scopes (bubbles) where each scope has its own
acceptance gate.

**Proof technique.**  Contradiction: a single function that agrees with
agent 1 on the witness claim must accept it; but then it also agrees with
agent 2, who rejects it. -/

/-- Two agents whose acceptance criteria disagree on at least one claim. -/
structure AgentDisagreement where
  Claim : Type
  /-- Agent 1's acceptance criterion. -/
  accept₁ : Claim → Prop
  /-- Agent 2's acceptance criterion. -/
  accept₂ : Claim → Prop
  /-- Witness claim where they disagree. -/
  witness : Claim
  /-- Agent 1 accepts the witness. -/
  agent1_accepts : accept₁ witness
  /-- Agent 2 rejects the witness. -/
  agent2_rejects : ¬accept₂ witness

/-- No single predicate can simultaneously agree with two disagreeing agents.
    A flat (single-scope) system commits to one acceptance function for all agents.
    When agents disagree, that function cannot faithfully represent both.

    Consequence: scope separation (bubbles) is structurally forced. -/
theorem flat_scope_impossible (D : AgentDisagreement) :
    ¬∃ (f : D.Claim → Prop), (∀ c, f c ↔ D.accept₁ c) ∧ (∀ c, f c ↔ D.accept₂ c) := by
  intro ⟨f, hf₁, hf₂⟩
  exact D.agent2_rejects ((hf₂ D.witness).mp ((hf₁ D.witness).mpr D.agent1_accepts))


/-! ### 1b. Alternative Scope Architectures Reduce to AgentDisagreement

A reviewer may ask: do capability systems, federated namespaces, or
dynamically parameterized acceptance gates escape `flat_scope_impossible`?

This section instantiates each alternative, then shows it either:
(a) directly supplies an `AgentDisagreement` instance, or
(b) embeds into per-agent scoped acceptance.

**Capability-token system.**  Each claim carries a capability token; acceptance
is token-gated.  Two agents with non-overlapping token sets disagree on the
witness claim: agent 1 holds the required token; agent 2 does not.
This is a direct `AgentDisagreement` instance — `flat_scope_impossible` applies.

**Federated namespace.**  A global namespace partitioned by scope identifier:
`accept(scope_id, claim) := local_policy scope_id claim`.  Two agents from
different scopes with conflicting local policies disagree on the witness claim.
Again a direct `AgentDisagreement` instance.

**Dynamically parameterized gate.**  Acceptance is `gate(params, claim)` for
some runtime parameter bundle.  If two agents use different parameter bundles
and disagree on the witness, the curried functions `gate params₁` and
`gate params₂` witness an `AgentDisagreement`.  If the gate is parameterized
such that no parameter assignment can satisfy both agents simultaneously, the
flat-scope impossibility applies directly.  If the gate CAN make both agents
agree on every claim, then by definition the agents do not genuinely disagree —
the scope pressure is absent and no bubble is forced for that pair.

**Conclusion of this section.**  None of the three alternative architectures
escapes the theorem.  They either instantiate `AgentDisagreement` directly or
they collapse to a case where the agents do not genuinely disagree (and hence
no scoped separation is required by this argument). -/

    holds the required token. -/

/-- A capability system with split token ownership instantiates AgentDisagreement.

/-! ### 2. Bounded Audit → Trust Bridges

**Argument.**  When full verification has unbounded cost, some claims
exceed any fixed budget.  A verification-only import policy (re-verify
every import from scratch) cannot handle those claims.  To import them
the system needs a trust-based mechanism: accept based on the source
scope's endorsement rather than full reverification.

**Proof technique.**  The hard claim's cost exceeds the budget;
Nat.not_le_of_gt closes the Nat contradiction. -/

/-- A claim universe where at least one claim exceeds the verification budget. -/
structure BoundedVerification where
  Claim : Type
  /-- Cost to fully verify a claim. -/

  hard_claim : Claim

/-! ### 2b. Alternative Trust Mechanisms Reduce to BoundedVerification

A reviewer may ask: do staged acceptance, probabilistic screening, escrowed
delay, or delegated verification markets escape `verification_only_import_incomplete`?

Each alternative is instantiated below.  All hit the same ceiling: at least
one claim exceeds the budget, and the alternative mechanism either (a) itself
exceeds the budget (same contradiction), or (b) relies on an endorsing scope
that bridges the local scope's budget shortfall.

**Staged acceptance.**  A multi-round protocol assigns partial costs per round.
If the sum of round costs for the hard claim still exceeds the budget, the
cumulative cost model is a `BoundedVerification` instance — contradiction fires.

**Delegated verification market.**  A third-party verifier handles hard claims.
The delegation is itself a trust relationship: the importing scope accepts
the delegate's endorsement without reverifying from scratch — a `DelegatedVerification`
instance under the structural definition above. -/

/-! ### §2c. Kernel Witness: BoundedVerification is Non-Vacuous by Construction

The `BoundedVerification` structure and `verification_only_import_incomplete`
are the architectural abstractions.  `DepthClaim` (EpArch.Concrete.VerificationDepth) is
their semantic ground: it witnesses that claim families with irreducible
verification cost exist within the kernel itself, not just as a structural
hypothesis.

The kernel must traverse all n constructors to type-check any proof of
`DepthClaim n`.  No budget below n suffices.  `bounded_verify_incomplete`
proves this by structural recursion on `Nat` — the recursion is the cost.

Consequence for trust bridges: a budget-n verifier cannot verify an
endorsement of `DepthClaim n`, since that endorsement has depth n+1
(`endorser_cannot_self_verify`).  The forcing argument of §2 applies to
this family without any coverage assumption. -/

/-- `BoundedVerification` has a canonical kernel inhabitant for every budget d.
    Claims are `Nat`-indexed depths; cost equals depth; depth d+1 exceeds
    budget d.  `DepthClaim (d+1)` is genuinely true (`depth_claim_provable`),
    so the incompleteness shown by `bounded_verify_incomplete` is real. -/
def depth_bounded_verification (d : Nat) : BoundedVerification where
  Claim          := Nat
  verify_cost    := id
  budget         := d
  hard_claim     := d + 1
  exceeds_budget := Nat.lt_succ_self d

/-- `verification_only_import_incomplete` fires on the kernel witness:
    no budget-d verifier covers the full `DepthClaim` family. -/
theorem depth_verification_incomplete (d : Nat) :
    ¬∀ c : (depth_bounded_verification d).Claim,
      (depth_bounded_verification d).verify_cost c ≤ (depth_bounded_verification d).budget :=

/-! ### 3. Export Across Boundaries → Headers (Metadata)

**Argument.**  When deposits cross scope boundaries the receiving scope
must decide whether to accept each import.  If the receiver has no
metadata about the deposit (no headers), every deposit looks identical —
the import function is uniform.  A uniform function cannot discriminate
good imports from bad.

**Proof technique.**  A uniform function produces `f good = f bad`
by definition; but sound-and-complete import requires different answers
for good and bad claims. -/

/-- Two claims that must be distinguished on import. -/
structure DiscriminatingImport where
  Claim : Type
  /-- A claim the receiver should accept. -/
  good : Claim
  /-- A claim the receiver should reject. -/
  bad : Claim
  good_ne_bad : good ≠ bad

/-- A function that treats all inputs uniformly produces the same output
    on good and bad claims — it cannot discriminate.

/-! ### 3b. Alternative Metadata Strategies Reduce to DiscriminatingImport

A reviewer may ask: do content-addressed routing or contextual routing state
escape `no_sound_complete_uniform_import`?

Both alternatives are instantiated below.  In each case the routing mechanism
either acts uniformly on claim content (same contradiction) or carries
structured per-claim metadata — a function satisfying `IsHeader`.

**Content-addressed routing.**  Import decisions are based solely on a content
hash.  If the hash function is collision-resistant, good and bad claims have
different hashes — but the import function now maps hash → Bool, and it must
still discriminate good from bad.  A uniform function over hashes collapses
the same way.  A non-uniform function over hashes maps distinct hashes to
distinct decisions, satisfying `IsHeader` on the embedded `DiscriminatingImport`.

**Contextual routing state.**  The receiver maintains external state that
routes each claim.  If the state is stored per-claim, it carries all the
information a header would carry — functionally equivalent.  If the state
is global (not per-claim), the import function is effectively uniform over
the claim dimension, and the same impossibility fires. -/

/-- Content-addressed import: the receiver routes by a hash of the claim. -/
structure ContentAddressedImport where
  Claim : Type
  Hash : Type
  /-- Collision-resistant hash function: good and bad have different hashes. -/

  bad : Claim
  hash_distinguishes : hash good ≠ hash bad
  /-- Import decision is a function of the hash only. -/
  import_by_hash : Hash → Bool

/-- Content-addressed import with distinguishing hashes is non-uniform: the
    import function over hashes must already discriminate good from bad hashes.
    That discrimination IS per-claim structured metadata — a header by another name.
    If `import_by_hash` were uniform (same output on all hashes), it could not
    distinguish good from bad claims — the same impossibility as `no_sound_complete_uniform_import`. -/

/-! ### 4. Adversarial Pressure → Revocation

**Argument.**  When adversarial deposits can pass acceptance, the system
must be able to remove them after discovering the problem.  In a lifecycle
where the "accepted" state is absorbing (no revocation transition), a
deposit that reaches "accepted" stays there through any number of
transitions.  The bad deposit is permanently accepted.

**Proof technique.**  Induction on the number of transition steps. -/

/-- Iterate a function `n` times starting from an initial value. -/

  accepted : State
  /-- The transition function. -/
  step : State → State
  /-- `accepted` is a fixed point: stepping from accepted returns accepted. -/
  absorbing : step accepted = accepted

/-- In a monotonic lifecycle, no sequence of transitions can escape
    the accepted state.  An adversarial deposit that passes acceptance
    stays accepted permanently.

    Consequence: a revocation mechanism is structurally forced. -/

    rw [ih, M.absorbing]


/-! ### 4b. Alternative Revocation Mechanisms Reduce to MonotonicLifecycle

A reviewer may ask: do quarantine states, shadow/hold states, or rollback
mechanisms escape `monotonic_no_exit`?

All three are instantiated below.  In each case the alternative either (a)
provides a non-absorbing transition out of the accepted state — the lifecycle
is non-monotonic — or (b) the accepted state remains absorbing and the alternative
does not actually remove the adversarial deposit from reliance.

**Quarantine state.**  If quarantine is reachable from accepted, the accepted
state is not absorbing — `step accepted ≠ accepted` for some step.  The
`MonotonicLifecycle.absorbing` condition is violated.

**Shadow/hold state.**  Same argument: if accepted can transition to hold,
the absorbing condition fails.  If hold is unreachable from accepted, the
bad deposit remains effectively accepted and the system fails corrigibility.

**Rollback.**  Rollback restores a prior state — a non-absorbing transition
out of accepted.  The absorbing condition is violated. -/

**Argument.**  When multiple agents must rely on the same deposits,
those deposits must be stored somewhere both agents can access.  In a
private-only storage model (each agent's store is invisible to others),
no deposit is simultaneously accessible to two agents.

**Proof technique.**  Contradiction with the isolation condition. -/

/-! ### 5b. Alternative Coordination Substrates Reduce to PrivateOnlyStorage

A reviewer may ask: do replicated logs, attestation networks, or CRDT-like
shared state escape `private_storage_no_sharing`?

All three are instantiated below.  In each case the alternative either (a)
provides shared access between the two agents, or (b) maintains isolation,
and `private_storage_no_sharing` fires directly.

**Replicated log.**  Each agent has a local replica, but replicas are
synchronized.  Synchronization means both agents can access the same deposit
entry — violation of the isolation condition.

**Attestation network.**  Agents publish signed claims accessible to others.
If agent₂ can read agent₁'s attestation, the isolation condition fails — both
agents have access.

**CRDT-based shared state.**  A conflict-free replicated data type by definition
converges to a shared state that all agents can read.  The convergence property
implies both agents access the same value — isolation is violated. -/

/-! ### 6. Truth Pressure → Redeemability

**Argument.**  In a closed endorsement system (no external constraint
surface), the only notion of "truth" is internal consensus.  Every claim
that passes consensus is true by definition — there is nothing external
it could fail against.  But truth pressure requires that some endorsed
claims CAN fail.  A closed system cannot satisfy truth pressure.

claims are unfalsifiable, but truth pressure supplies one that is
endorsed AND falsifiable. -/

closed and `closed_system_unfalsifiable` fires directly.

**Anomaly signaling.**  The system can emit anomaly signals but ignores them:
no endorsed claim becomes externally falsifiable from the signal alone.
The closure condition is preserved — signals without action leave the
endorsement-falsifiability structure unchanged.

**Partial contestation.**  Only some claims are contestable.  For the
non-contestable endorsed claims, the closure condition still holds.
The closed system theorem applies to that sub-population.

**Soft falsifiability.**  Claims can be flagged as uncertain but are not
actually falsifiable (not removed from endorsement).  If flagging does not
imply external falsifiability, the closure condition holds — the same
impossibility applies. -/

/-! ### §6c. Forcing Stratification: Hard vs Soft Forcing for Truth Pressure

The eight forcing dimensions do not all have the same tightness.

Hard forcing: impossibility follows from the structure alone, without additional
behavioral coverage assumptions.  Scope, revocation, bank, partial contestation,
authorization, and storage belong to this tier.

Soft forcing: impossibility requires an additional coverage assumption
(`∀ c, endorsed c → emits_anomaly c` / `flagged c`), which cannot be
discharged from the structure fields alone.

`anomaly_not_hard_forced` and `soft_falsifiability_not_hard_forced` exhibit consistent
`AnomalySignaling` / `SoftFalsifiability` instances with an endorsed, externally-falsifiable
claim.  `partial_contestation_hard_forced` shows partial contestation does not require
a coverage assumption. -/

/-! ### 7. Multi-Agent Heterogeneous Access → Granular ACL

**Argument.**  When a system has a staged access surface — an open submission
tier and a restricted commit tier — no single authorization predicate can
faithfully represent both tiers simultaneously.  Suppose it could: then the
flat function agrees with the open tier (so the submitter is authorized under
it), and it also agrees with the commit tier (so the submitter has commit
rights) — contradicting the submitter’s known restriction on the commit tier.
Granular ACL, which keeps the two tiers distinct, is structurally forced.

Examples: a GitHub repository has open PRs (submission) but maintainer-gated
merges (commit); a bank has open deposits (submission) but ACL-gated withdrawals
(commit); a corporate intranet may have a fully closed commit tier where even
submission requires clearance — in that case both tiers are equally restricted,
no `TwoTierAccess` certificate exists, and `S.multi_agent = false` is correct.

**Proof technique.**  Exact structural parallel to `flat_scope_impossible`.
Two predicates (`can_propose`, `can_commit`) disagree on a witness (`submitter`
for `tier_claim`).  A flat function faithful to both routes `may_propose`
through the proposal iff and then through the commit iff to
`can_commit submitter tier_claim`, contradicting `cannot_commit`.  The proof
uses all three witnesses: `may_propose`, `cannot_commit`, and `may_commit`
(the last establishes that the commit tier is non-vacuous and structurally
distinct from the proposal tier). -/

/-- A staged-access scenario: one agent can submit but cannot commit; another
    agent can commit.  No single authorization predicate can faithfully represent
    both the submission tier and the commit tier simultaneously.

    Structural parallel to `AgentDisagreement` for scope: both have two predicates
    on the same type and a witness on which they disagree. -/
structure TwoTierAccess where
  Agent         : Type
  Claim         : Type
  /-- The open submission tier: agents that may propose/submit. -/
  can_propose   : Agent → Claim → Prop
  /-- The restricted commit tier: agents that may merge/commit. -/
  can_commit    : Agent → Claim → Prop
  /-- An agent in the submission tier but not the commit tier. -/
  submitter     : Agent
  /-- An agent in the commit tier — establishes the commit tier is non-vacuous. -/
  committer     : Agent
  /-- The claim on which the two tiers differ. -/
  tier_claim    : Claim
  /-- The submitter can propose the tier claim. -/
  may_propose   : can_propose submitter tier_claim
  /-- The submitter cannot commit the tier claim. -/
  cannot_commit : ¬can_commit submitter tier_claim
  /-- The committer can commit the tier claim — the commit tier is non-vacuous. -/
  may_commit    : can_commit committer tier_claim

/-- No flat authorization predicate can faithfully represent both the submission
    tier and the commit tier of a two-tier access scenario.

    Proof: a flat `f` faithful to both tiers routes `may_propose` through
    `f submitter tier_claim` (via the proposal iff) and then to
    `can_commit submitter tier_claim` (via the commit iff) — contradicting
    `cannot_commit`.

    Exact structural parallel to `flat_scope_impossible`: two predicates that
    disagree on a witness; no flat function can represent both.

    Consequence: granular ACL is structurally forced — the two access surfaces
    cannot be collapsed into a single authorization predicate. -/

/-! ### 7b. Alternative Authorization Mechanisms Reduce to TwoTierAccess

A reviewer may ask: do RBAC (role-based ACL), capability-token systems, or
attribute-based ACL escape `flat_authorization_impossible`?

This section instantiates each alternative, then shows it directly supplies
a `GroundedAuthorization` instance (with both a positive and a negative witness).
`GroundedAuthorizationStrict.no_flat_tier` then fires directly, or
equivalently, `flat_authorization_impossible` fires via `groundedAuthorization_to_scenario`.

**RBAC.**  The commit tier is role-derived authorization; the submission tier is
open (any agent may submit).  The restricted agent's role lacks commit permission;
the privileged agent's role has it.  `cannot_commit` and `may_commit` are both
required to derive `no_flat_tier`.

**Capability-token system.**  The commit tier is token-based authorization; the
submission tier is open.  The restricted agent holds no commit token; the privileged
agent holds one.  Again a direct `GroundedAuthorization` instance.

**Attribute-based ACL.**  The commit tier requires all demanded attributes; the
submission tier is open.  The restricted agent lacks a required attribute; the
privileged agent has all required attributes.  Again a direct `GroundedAuthorization`
instance.

**Conclusion.**  All three alternatives instantiate `GroundedAuthorization` with
both `may_commit` and `cannot_commit`.  The impossibility fires via
`GroundedAuthorizationStrict.no_flat_tier` — the authorization pressure requires
structural tension between the two tiers, not a single restriction alone.  The
forcing is insensitive to the ACL mechanism chosen. -/

/-! ## §7. GroundedX ↔ Impossibility Bridges

Each `GroundedX` structure is isomorphic to the *input* of the corresponding
impossibility theorem (§1–§8).  These bridge theorems make the connection
explicit: given any `GroundedX` witness, the matching impossibility result fires.

`GroundedXStrict` packages the base evidence with its impossibility consequence —
the non-trivial `Prop` that falls out of the bridge.

**Relation to WorkingSystem.**  `WorkingSystem` carries eight `Option GroundedXStrict`
fields.  The `GroundedXStrict` structures are defined in EpArch.SystemSpec (where
they only depend on `GroundedX` fields).

**Construction convention.**
- `G.toStrict` — standard path; inline proof from base fields (in EpArch.SystemSpec,
  no dependency on the named theorems here).  Used by `withGroundedBehavior`,
  `ConcreteWorkingSystem`, and `PartialGroundedSpec.toWorkingSystem`.
- `GroundedXStrict.mk' G` — thin alias: `mk' G := G.toStrict`.  Kept as the
  canonical citation-facing constructor; call it when you want the named-proof
  route to appear in a proof term without inlining the derivation.
- Named bridge theorems (`groundedBubbles_flat_impossible`, etc.) — available for
  direct citation when a proof must explicitly invoke the structural impossibility.
  No longer called by `mk'`, but remain at module scope for that purpose. -/

    8. Bounded Storage → Storage Management
    ========================================================================

**Argument.**  Any finite storage capacity can be exceeded by a sufficient
number of active deposits.  A system without a management mechanism (eviction,
archival, or pruning) cannot remain within its budget indefinitely.

**Proof technique.**  Direct witness: the `BoundedStorage` structure carries
a concrete state (`deep_state`) whose active-deposit count exceeds the budget.
The impossibility theorem simply applies the universal bound to this state
and derives a contradiction.

    a concrete overflow state.

/-! ### 8b. Alternative Storage Architectures Reduce to BoundedStorage

A reviewer may ask: do append-only logs, versioned entry stores, or
per-partition quota schemes escape `monotone_active_accumulation_overflows`?

All three are instantiated below.  In each case the alternative carries a
concrete overflow state and an exceed-budget proof — a direct `BoundedStorage`
instance — and the impossibility fires via the standard embedding.

**Append-only log.**  Entries are appended but never deleted; the active-entry
count is monotonically non-decreasing.  A log that has accumulated more than
`budget` entries is the overflow state.  Without an archival or compaction
mechanism, the count cannot be bounded — a direct `BoundedStorage` instance.

**Versioned entry store.**  Each update creates a new version; all versions
are retained indefinitely for audit or rollback.  Version count is the
active-deposit proxy.  Without compaction or garbage collection, the count
exceeds any fixed budget — a direct `BoundedStorage` instance.

**Per-partition quota store.**  Storage is divided into named partitions
(tenants, shards, epochs); each partition carries its own local count.  Without
cross-partition capacity enforcement, a single partition can accumulate more
entries than the global budget.  The overflow partition supplies the
`BoundedStorage` overflow witness. -/

/-- Append-only log: entries are only ever appended; the active count is
    monotonically non-decreasing.

    §9. BOUNDED RECALL — τ-Expiry as a Forced Consequence of Bounded
        Verification Budget
    ========================================================================

    **Argument.** When an agent recalls a banked deposit, it must re-verify
    that the deposit's provenance chain (V) is still intact and that the
    claim still meets the current standard (S).  If V-chain depth has grown
    unboundedly since the deposit was first accepted, the re-verification cost
    at recall time grows with that depth.  For any fixed budget there exist
    deposits whose accumulated V-chain depth exceeds the budget.  An agent
    with a fixed recall budget therefore cannot re-verify all banked deposits
    on demand.

    **Consequence.** Without a recency filter, a bounded-budget agent
    accumulates irrecallable deposits — entries that remain formally Deposited
    but cannot be re-verified at recall time.  τ-expiry is a forced response:
    it ensures the deposits an agent must re-verify at withdrawal time have
    bounded provenance depth, because they are recent.

    **Proof technique.** Parallel to BoundedVerification (§2).  A
    `RecallBudget` witness carries a provenance chain exceeding the budget.
    `recall_only_withdrawal_incomplete` closes via `Nat.not_le_of_gt`.  The
    forcing theorem connects this impossibility to τ-expiry as a sufficient
    recency filter. -/

/-! ## §9.1  RecallBudget Structure -/

/-- A claim universe where re-verification cost at withdrawal time grows with
    provenance depth.  The agent has a fixed recall budget; any deposit whose

    **Proof strategy:** apply the universal bound to `M.deep_chain`, which carries

/-! ## §9.4  Abstract Impossibility Under Recency Window

This is the abstract counterpart to `bounded_capacity_without_storage_embeds`:
given a `RecallBudget` and the hypothesis that all provenance chains fit within
`tau_window`, the impossibility fires.  This is the right-branch core that the
Scenarios-layer forcing theorem (`bounded_recall_forces_recency_management`)
wraps with a `WorkingSystem` and a `HasRecencyFilter` conclusion. -/

/-- ABSTRACT IMPOSSIBILITY: V-chain universality contradicts the recall budget.

    If all provenance chains fit within `tau_window` and `tau_window = M.budget`,
    then the universal `∀ v, M.recall_cost v ≤ M.budget` contradicts
    `recall_only_withdrawal_incomplete`.

    This is the abstract right-branch embedding step.  The per-dimension
    forcing conclusion — `HasRecencyFilter W` — is produced by
    `bounded_recall_forces_recency_management` in `EpArch.Scenarios`.

    **Scope notes.**
    - Does not prove: τ is the *only* valid recency filter.  Priority-based
      eviction or capacity-triggered compaction also satisfy the obligation
      (see §9b).
    - Does not prove: the recall budget equals the τ window.  The forcing
      argument shows `tau_window = budget` is sufficient; an implementation
      may use a more conservative window.
    - Does not prove: V-chain growth is exactly one hop per time unit.  The
      formal bound is a hypothesis supplied by the caller. -/

A reviewer may ask: do priority-based eviction, versioned-provenance

`recall_only_withdrawal_incomplete`?

All three are instantiated below.  In each case the alternative carries a
concrete deep provenance chain and an exceed-budget proof — a direct
`RecallBudget` instance — and the impossibility fires via the standard
embedding.

**Accumulating provenance.**  Each endorsement step appends a new link;
recall cost grows with the number of endorsements.  A chain that has
accumulated more than `budget` endorsement hops is the overflow witness.
Without a recency filter, the chain depth can grow without bound — a
direct `RecallBudget` instance.

**Versioned provenance.**  Claim updates accumulate a new provenance
version for each update; recall cost is proportional to the version count.
Without eviction of stale versions, the per-entry recall cost grows with
update frequency — a direct `RecallBudget` instance.

**Sharded recall.**  Provenance chains are partitioned into named recall
shards (by topic, epoch, or tenant).  Each shard accumulates depth
independently.  Without cross-shard depth enforcement, a single shard can
accumulate chains exceeding the global recall budget — a direct

/-! ### §9.6  Recall ↔ BoundedRecall Bridge

`RecallBudget` embeds into `BoundedVerification` in the recall direction:
provenance depth plays the role that claim depth plays in the import direction.
The impossibility fires via the same arithmetic path. -/

/-- `RecallBudget` embeds into `BoundedVerification`: provenance depth is the
    verification cost; budget and hard-claim map directly.

    This makes explicit that the recall impossibility is an instance of the
    general bounded-budget impossibility — the same Nat arithmetic closes both. -/
def recallBudget_to_bounded (M : RecallBudget) : BoundedVerification where
  Claim          := M.Provenance
  verify_cost    := M.recall_cost
  budget         := M.budget
  hard_claim     := M.deep_chain
  exceeds_budget := M.exceeds_budget

/-- `recall_only_withdrawal_incomplete` is an instance of
    `verification_only_import_incomplete` via the embedding.

    Confirms that the recall and import impossibilities share the same
    formal structure: both close via `Nat.not_le_of_gt`. -/
