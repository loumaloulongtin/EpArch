Minimality and Impossibility Theorems

Formal convergence result: any system satisfying the operational
constraints necessarily contains the Bank primitives.  The theorems
here prove this via structural impossibility: remove primitive X and
constraint Y cannot be satisfied.

The core claim is convergence under constraints, not metaphysical necessity.
These theorems formalize that convergence.

## Central Role

This file contains the structural impossibility models from which the
convergence result follows.  The convergence theorem itself
(`convergence_structural`) lives in `Convergence.lean`.  Each scenario
proves: remove primitive X and the system cannot satisfy operational
constraint Y — establishing necessity per dimension.

This is convergence, not uniqueness: any working solution must contain
these structural elements, but implementations can differ.

/-! ## Constraints Typeclass (Minimal Constraints)

The minimal constraints table has three columns:
  | Constraint | What It Forces | If Relaxed |

This typeclass captures the constraint column. The "What It Forces" is captured
by the convergence theorem and impossibility theorems below. -/

/-- Predicate: agent controls acceptance for a bubble. -/
opaque controls_acceptance : Agent → Bubble → Prop

/-- Predicate: claim can be fully verified within available resources. -/
opaque can_fully_verify : PropLike → Prop

/-- Predicate: deposit is an adversarial injection (fabricated claim/header). -/
opaque is_adversarial_injection : Deposit PropLike Standard ErrorModel Provenance → Prop

/-- Predicate: deposit passed the bubble's acceptance protocol. -/
opaque passed_acceptance : Bubble → Deposit PropLike Standard ErrorModel Provenance → Prop

/-- The minimal constraints encoded as a typeclass.
    Each field corresponds to one row of the constraint table.
    The semantic content captures the informal descriptions. -/
class Constraints (B : Bank (PropLike := PropLike)
    (Standard := Standard) (ErrorModel := ErrorModel) (Provenance := Provenance)) : Prop where

  /-- **Distributed agents**: No single agent controls all bubble acceptance.
      If relaxed: single agent control suffices; no Bank needed. -/
  distributed_agents : ¬∃ (controller : Agent), ∀ (B : Bubble), controls_acceptance controller B

  /-- **Bounded audit**: Some claims cannot be fully verified.
      If relaxed: unbounded audit; full revalidation always; no need for trust-based import. -/
  bounded_audit : ∃ (P : PropLike), ¬can_fully_verify P

  /-- **Export across boundaries**: Deposits propagate between distinct bubbles.
      If relaxed: isolated bubbles; coordination collapses but no contamination. -/
  export_across_boundaries : ∃ (B1 B2 : Bubble) (d : Deposit PropLike Standard ErrorModel Provenance),
    B1 ≠ B2 ∧ exportDep B1 B2 d

  /-- **Adversarial/corruption pressure**: Adversarial deposits can pass acceptance.
      If relaxed: weaker V requirements; simpler hygiene.
      Note: The PRESSURE is that bad deposits sometimes succeed. -/
  adversarial_pressure : ∃ (B : Bubble) (d : Deposit PropLike Standard ErrorModel Provenance),
    is_adversarial_injection d ∧ passed_acceptance B d

  /-- **Coordination need**: Multiple agents must rely on shared deposits.
      If relaxed: no coordination; each agent runs solo. -/
  coordination_need : ∃ (a1 a2 : Agent) (B : Bubble) (d : Deposit PropLike Standard ErrorModel Provenance),
    a1 ≠ a2 ∧ withdraw a1 B d ∧ withdraw a2 B d

  /-- **Truth pressure (redeemability)**: Deposits can fail constraint-surface contact.
      If relaxed: self-agreement suffices; system drifts into unfalsifiable consensus. -/
  truth_pressure : ∃ (d : Deposit PropLike Standard ErrorModel Provenance),
    d.status = .Deposited ∧ ¬redeemable d


/-! ## Working System Abstraction -/

/-- A "working system" that coordinates under uncertainty.

    This abstracts over any system that successfully enables coordination
    while handling the constraints above. Such systems converge on
    Bank-like primitives. -/

/-! ## Forced Feature Predicates

These are definitional predicates that inspect the WorkingSystem's
SystemSpec to determine if features are present. Each predicate
corresponds to one "What It Forces" entry in the constraints table. -/

/-- Predicate: system has scoped trust zones (bubbles), not a global ledger.
    Forced by: Distributed agents -/
def HasBubbles (W : WorkingSystem) : Prop := W.spec.has_bubble_separation = true

/-- Predicate: system has trust bridges (import-via-trust without full revalidation).

/-- Predicate: system has structured headers (S/E/V) + export gates.
    Forced by: Export across boundaries -/

/-- Predicate: system has redeemability (constraint-surface contact).
    Forced by: Truth pressure -/

/-! ## Pressure: The Canonical Dimension Index

`Pressure` is the machine-exhaustive index of EpArch's six architectural
forcing dimensions.  Using it as the canonical index for `handles_pressure`,
`forced_feature`, `SatisfiesAllProperties`, and `containsBankPrimitives`
means the coverage of the framework — exactly these six and no others —
is a typed fact, not a counting convention.

A proof that pattern-matches on `Pressure` is checked by Lean for
exhaustiveness: adding a seventh dimension requires adding a seventh
constructor here, which would break every existing `cases P` proof
until the new forcing chain is supplied. -/

/-- The six architectural pressure dimensions of EpArch. -/

/-! ## Constraint Subset and Partial Well-Formedness

These definitions live here (in `EpArch`) so that:
1. `grounded_partial_wellformed` (below) can reference them without a circular import.
2. `EpArch.Meta.Modular` (which imports this file via `import EpArch.Minimality`) inherits
   them transitively and can build `projection_valid`, `modular`, `PartialGroundedSpec`, etc.
   on top, all visible under `open EpArch`. -/

/-- A subset of the six EpArch operational constraints, represented as a
    6-boolean vector. `true` = constraint included; `false` = dropped.

    Examples:
    - `allConstraints`  — all six included (strongest case)
    - `noConstraints`   — none included (no forcing theorems claimed)
    - `⟨true, false, false, false, true, false⟩` — only distributed + coordination -/
structure ConstraintSubset where
  distributed    : Bool
  bounded_audit  : Bool
  export_across  : Bool
  adversarial    : Bool

  truth_pressure : Bool

/-- The empty subset. `PartialWellFormed W noConstraints` holds trivially. -/
def noConstraints : ConstraintSubset := ⟨false, false, false, false, false, false⟩

/-- `PartialWellFormed W S` captures the forcing biconditionals for
    the constraint subset S.

    For each constraint X:
    - If `S.X = true`,  the biconditional `handles_X W ↔ HasFeature_X W` is required.
    - If `S.X = false`, nothing is required for X.

    Requiring all six (S = allConstraints) is the strongest form. -/

  wf_truth_pressure : S.truth_pressure = true → (handles_truth_pressure W ↔ HasRedeemability W)


/-! ## Grounded Behavioral Evidence

`WorkingSystem` now carries six proof-carrying `Option GroundedX` fields, one per
architectural forcing dimension.  The same evidence-bridge pattern applies: instead
of writing `bubbles_ev := some G` by hand, supply a `GroundedBehavior` record and
let `withGroundedBehavior` set each option to `some`.

The six capability witnesses correspond exactly to the six `GroundedX` structures:

| WorkingSystem field  | GroundedX type         | Forcing dimension                                     |
|----------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `bubbles_ev`         | `GroundedBubbles`      | Distributed agents — scope separation                 |
| `bridges_ev`         | `GroundedTrustBridges` | Bounded audit — trust bridges                         |
| `headers_ev`         | `GroundedHeaders`      | Export across boundaries — header preservation        |
| `revocation_ev`      | `GroundedRevocation`   | Adversarial pressure — revocation                     |
| `bank_ev`            | `GroundedBank`         | Coordination need — shared ledger                     |
| `redeemability_ev`   | `GroundedRedeemability`| Truth pressure — redeemability                        | -/

/-- Evidence for all six behavioral capabilities of a `WorkingSystem`.

    One `GroundedX` field per forcing dimension.  Supplying a `GroundedBehavior`
    to `withGroundedBehavior` sets each `Option GroundedX` field in `WorkingSystem`
    to `some`, replacing the legacy Bool flags with proof-carrying fields. -/
structure GroundedBehavior where
  /-- Scope separation: two acceptance scopes disagree on a witness claim. -/
  bubbles       : GroundedBubbles

    bank_ev          := some B.bank
    redeemability_ev := some B.redeemability }

/-- A `WorkingSystem` built from `GroundedBehavior` satisfies all six operational
    properties.  The proof unfolds to checking `true = true` after applying
    `withGroundedBehavior`, but the `true` was set because evidence was supplied. -/

/-- A `WorkingSystem` built from both `GroundedBehavior` and `GroundedSystemSpec`
    satisfies `PartialWellFormed W allConstraints`.

    The six biconditionals pair behavioral evidence (Option fields) with spec flags.
    `withGroundedBehavior` sets each `Option GroundedX` to `some`, so
    `W.x_ev.isSome = true` is definitionally true.
    `GroundedSystemSpec.toSystemSpec` sets each spec Bool flag via the
    `withGroundedX` chain, so each `HasX W = true` follows from
    `grounded_spec_contains_all G`.

    Each biconditional direction uses a named theorem rather than opaque `simp`:
    - Forward (handles → HasX): `(grounded_spec_contains_all G).nth`
    - Backward (HasX → handles): `rfl` on `(some _).isSome = true` -/

    Structural Forcing Models
    ========================================================================

This section provides **independent, structurally-grounded proofs** for
each forcing direction.  Each model captures the essential structure of
one constraint scenario and proves an impossibility or invariance result
from that structure alone — no biconditionals needed.

### Summary

| # | Constraint | Model | Theorem | Content |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Distributed agents | `AgentDisagreement` | `flat_scope_impossible` | Single scope can't represent disagreeing agents |
| 2 | Bounded audit | `BoundedVerification` | `verification_only_import_incomplete` | Verification-only import can't handle all claims |
| 3 | Export | `DiscriminatingImport` | `uniform_import_nondiscriminating` | Without metadata, import can't distinguish claims |
| 4 | Adversarial | `MonotonicLifecycle` | `monotonic_no_exit` | Without revocation, accepted state is absorbing |
| 5 | Coordination | `PrivateOnlyStorage` | `private_storage_no_sharing` | Isolated storage blocks collective reliance |
| 6 | Truth pressure | `ClosedEndorsement` | `closed_system_unfalsifiable` | Without external contact, consensus is unfalsifiable |

After the six models, the convergence proof machinery (`StructurallyForced`,
`ForcingEmbedding`, Bridge predicates, Scenario predicates,
`convergence_structural`) lives in `Convergence.lean`.

/-! ### 1. Distributed Agents → Scope Separation (Bubbles)

**Argument.**  If two agents have genuinely different acceptance criteria,
no single flat acceptance function can faithfully represent both.  The
system must partition into scopes (bubbles) where each scope has its own
acceptance gate.

**Proof technique.**  Contradiction: a single function that agrees with
agent 1 on the witness claim must accept it; but then it also agrees with
agent 2, who rejects it. -/

/-- Two agents whose acceptance criteria disagree on at least one claim. -/
structure AgentDisagreement where
  Claim : Type
  /-- Agent 1's acceptance criterion. -/
  accept₁ : Claim → Prop
  /-- Agent 2's acceptance criterion. -/
  accept₂ : Claim → Prop
  /-- Witness claim where they disagree. -/
  witness : Claim
  /-- Agent 1 accepts the witness. -/
  agent1_accepts : accept₁ witness
  /-- Agent 2 rejects the witness. -/
  agent2_rejects : ¬accept₂ witness

/-- No single predicate can simultaneously agree with two disagreeing agents.
    A flat (single-scope) system commits to one acceptance function for all agents.
    When agents disagree, that function cannot faithfully represent both.

    Consequence: scope separation (bubbles) is structurally forced. -/
theorem flat_scope_impossible (D : AgentDisagreement) :
    ¬∃ (f : D.Claim → Prop), (∀ c, f c ↔ D.accept₁ c) ∧ (∀ c, f c ↔ D.accept₂ c) := by
  intro ⟨f, hf₁, hf₂⟩
  exact D.agent2_rejects ((hf₂ D.witness).mp ((hf₁ D.witness).mpr D.agent1_accepts))


/-! ### 1b. Alternative Scope Architectures Reduce to AgentDisagreement

A reviewer may ask: do capability systems, federated namespaces, or
dynamically parameterized acceptance gates escape `flat_scope_impossible`?

This section instantiates each alternative, then shows it either:
(a) directly supplies an `AgentDisagreement` instance, or
(b) embeds into per-agent scoped acceptance.

**Capability-token system.**  Each claim carries a capability token; acceptance
is token-gated.  Two agents with non-overlapping token sets disagree on the
witness claim: agent 1 holds the required token; agent 2 does not.
This is a direct `AgentDisagreement` instance — `flat_scope_impossible` applies.

**Federated namespace.**  A global namespace partitioned by scope identifier:
`accept(scope_id, claim) := local_policy scope_id claim`.  Two agents from
different scopes with conflicting local policies disagree on the witness claim.
Again a direct `AgentDisagreement` instance.

**Dynamically parameterized gate.**  Acceptance is `gate(params, claim)` for
some runtime parameter bundle.  If two agents use different parameter bundles
and disagree on the witness, the curried functions `gate params₁` and
`gate params₂` witness an `AgentDisagreement`.  If the gate is parameterized
such that no parameter assignment can satisfy both agents simultaneously, the
flat-scope impossibility applies directly.  If the gate CAN make both agents
agree on every claim, then by definition the agents do not genuinely disagree —
the scope pressure is absent and no bubble is forced for that pair.

**Conclusion of this section.**  None of the three alternative architectures
escapes the theorem.  They either instantiate `AgentDisagreement` directly or
they collapse to a case where the agents do not genuinely disagree (and hence
no scoped separation is required by this argument). -/

    holds the required token. -/

/-- A capability system with split token ownership instantiates AgentDisagreement.

/-! ### 2. Bounded Audit → Trust Bridges

**Argument.**  When full verification has unbounded cost, some claims
exceed any fixed budget.  A verification-only import policy (re-verify
every import from scratch) cannot handle those claims.  To import them
the system needs a trust-based mechanism: accept based on the source
scope's endorsement rather than full reverification.

**Proof technique.**  The hard claim's cost exceeds the budget; omega
closes the Nat contradiction. -/

/-! ### 2b. Alternative Trust Mechanisms Reduce to BoundedVerification

A reviewer may ask: do staged acceptance, probabilistic screening, escrowed
delay, or delegated verification markets escape `verification_only_import_incomplete`?

Each alternative is instantiated below.  All hit the same ceiling: at least
one claim exceeds the budget, and the alternative mechanism either (a) itself
exceeds the budget (same contradiction), or (b) relies on an endorsing scope
that bridges the local scope's budget shortfall.

**Staged acceptance.**  A multi-round protocol assigns partial costs per round.
If the sum of round costs for the hard claim still exceeds the budget, the
cumulative cost model is a `BoundedVerification` instance — contradiction fires.

**Delegated verification market.**  A third-party verifier handles hard claims.
The delegation is itself a trust relationship: the importing scope accepts
the delegate's endorsement without reverifying from scratch — a `DelegatedVerification`
instance under the structural definition above. -/

/-! ### §2c. Kernel Witness: BoundedVerification is Non-Vacuous by Construction

The `BoundedVerification` structure and `verification_only_import_incomplete`
are the architectural abstractions.  `DepthClaim` (VerificationDepth.lean) is
their semantic ground: it witnesses that claim families with irreducible
verification cost exist within the kernel itself, not just as a structural
hypothesis.

The kernel must traverse all n constructors to type-check any proof of
`DepthClaim n`.  No budget below n suffices.  `bounded_verify_incomplete`
proves this by structural recursion on `Nat` — the recursion is the cost.

Consequence for trust bridges: a budget-n verifier cannot verify an
endorsement of `DepthClaim n`, since that endorsement has depth n+1
(`endorser_cannot_self_verify`).  The forcing argument of §2 applies to
this family without any coverage assumption. -/

/-- `BoundedVerification` has a canonical kernel inhabitant for every budget d.
    Claims are `Nat`-indexed depths; cost equals depth; depth d+1 exceeds
    budget d.  `DepthClaim (d+1)` is genuinely true (`depth_claim_provable`),
    so the incompleteness shown by `bounded_verify_incomplete` is real. -/

  Claim          := Nat
  verify_cost    := id

  exceeds_budget := Nat.lt_succ_self d

/-- `verification_only_import_incomplete` fires on the kernel witness:
    no budget-d verifier covers the full `DepthClaim` family. -/

    ¬∀ c : (depth_bounded_verification d).Claim,

/-! ### 3. Export Across Boundaries → Headers (Metadata)

**Argument.**  When deposits cross scope boundaries the receiving scope
must decide whether to accept each import.  If the receiver has no
metadata about the deposit (no headers), every deposit looks identical —
the import function is uniform.  A uniform function cannot discriminate
good imports from bad.

**Proof technique.**  A uniform function produces `f good = f bad`
by definition; but sound-and-complete import requires different answers
for good and bad claims. -/

/-- Two claims that must be distinguished on import. -/

  Claim : Type
  /-- A claim the receiver should accept. -/
  good : Claim
  /-- A claim the receiver should reject. -/

/-! ### 3b. Alternative Metadata Strategies Reduce to DiscriminatingImport

A reviewer may ask: do content-addressed routing or contextual routing state
escape `no_sound_complete_uniform_import`?

Both alternatives are instantiated below.  In each case the routing mechanism
either acts uniformly on claim content (same contradiction) or carries
structured per-claim metadata — a function satisfying `IsHeader`.

**Content-addressed routing.**  Import decisions are based solely on a content
hash.  If the hash function is collision-resistant, good and bad claims have
different hashes — but the import function now maps hash → Bool, and it must
still discriminate good from bad.  A uniform function over hashes collapses
the same way.  A non-uniform function over hashes maps distinct hashes to
distinct decisions, satisfying `IsHeader` on the embedded `DiscriminatingImport`.

**Contextual routing state.**  The receiver maintains external state that
routes each claim.  If the state is stored per-claim, it carries all the
information a header would carry — functionally equivalent.  If the state
is global (not per-claim), the import function is effectively uniform over
the claim dimension, and the same impossibility fires. -/

/-- Content-addressed import: the receiver routes by a hash of the claim. -/
structure ContentAddressedImport where
  Claim : Type
  Hash : Type
  /-- Collision-resistant hash function: good and bad have different hashes. -/

  /-- Import decision is a function of the hash only. -/
  import_by_hash : Hash → Bool

/-- Content-addressed import with distinguishing hashes is non-uniform: the
    import function over hashes must already discriminate good from bad hashes.
    That discrimination IS per-claim structured metadata — a header by another name.
    If `import_by_hash` were uniform (same output on all hashes), it could not
    distinguish good from bad claims — the same impossibility as `no_sound_complete_uniform_import`. -/

/-! ### 4. Adversarial Pressure → Revocation

**Argument.**  When adversarial deposits can pass acceptance, the system
must be able to remove them after discovering the problem.  In a lifecycle
where the "accepted" state is absorbing (no revocation transition), a
deposit that reaches "accepted" stays there through any number of
transitions.  The bad deposit is permanently accepted.

**Proof technique.**  Induction on the number of transition steps. -/

/-- Iterate a function `n` times starting from an initial value. -/
def iter (f : α → α) : Nat → α → α

  | n + 1, x => f (iter f n x)

  accepted : State
  /-- The transition function. -/
  step : State → State
  /-- `accepted` is a fixed point: stepping from accepted returns accepted. -/
  absorbing : step accepted = accepted

/-- In a monotonic lifecycle, no sequence of transitions can escape
    the accepted state.  An adversarial deposit that passes acceptance
    stays accepted permanently.

    Consequence: a revocation mechanism is structurally forced. -/

    iter M.step n M.accepted = M.accepted := by
  induction n with
  | zero => rfl
  | succ n ih =>

    rw [ih, M.absorbing]


/-! ### 4b. Alternative Revocation Mechanisms Reduce to MonotonicLifecycle

A reviewer may ask: do quarantine states, shadow/hold states, or rollback
mechanisms escape `monotonic_no_exit`?

All three are instantiated below.  In each case the alternative either (a)
provides a non-absorbing transition out of the accepted state — the lifecycle
is non-monotonic — or (b) the accepted state remains absorbing and the alternative
does not actually remove the adversarial deposit from reliance.

**Quarantine state.**  If quarantine is reachable from accepted, the accepted
state is not absorbing — `step accepted ≠ accepted` for some step.  The
`MonotonicLifecycle.absorbing` condition is violated.

**Shadow/hold state.**  Same argument: if accepted can transition to hold,
the absorbing condition fails.  If hold is unreachable from accepted, the
bad deposit remains effectively accepted and the system fails corrigibility.

**Rollback.**  Rollback restores a prior state — a non-absorbing transition
out of accepted.  The absorbing condition is violated. -/

**Argument.**  When multiple agents must rely on the same deposits,
those deposits must be stored somewhere both agents can access.  In a
private-only storage model (each agent's store is invisible to others),
no deposit is simultaneously accessible to two agents.

**Proof technique.**  Contradiction with the isolation condition. -/

/-! ### 5b. Alternative Coordination Substrates Reduce to PrivateOnlyStorage

A reviewer may ask: do replicated logs, attestation networks, or CRDT-like
shared state escape `private_storage_no_sharing`?

All three are instantiated below.  In each case the alternative either (a)
provides shared access between the two agents, or (b) maintains isolation,
and `private_storage_no_sharing` fires directly.

**Replicated log.**  Each agent has a local replica, but replicas are
synchronized.  Synchronization means both agents can access the same deposit
entry — violation of the isolation condition.

**Attestation network.**  Agents publish signed claims accessible to others.
If agent₂ can read agent₁'s attestation, the isolation condition fails — both
agents have access.

**CRDT-based shared state.**  A conflict-free replicated data type by definition
converges to a shared state that all agents can read.  The convergence property
implies both agents access the same value — isolation is violated. -/

/-! ### 6. Truth Pressure → Redeemability

**Argument.**  In a closed endorsement system (no external constraint
surface), the only notion of "truth" is internal consensus.  Every claim
that passes consensus is true by definition — there is nothing external
it could fail against.  But truth pressure requires that some endorsed
claims CAN fail.  A closed system cannot satisfy truth pressure.

**Proof technique.**  Contradiction: the closure condition holds that endorsed

/-! ### 6b. Alternative External Contact Mechanisms Reduce to ClosedEndorsement

A reviewer may ask: do anomaly signaling, partial contestation, or soft
falsifiability escape `closed_system_unfalsifiable`?

All three are instantiated below.  In each case the mechanism either (a)
provides genuine external falsifiability, or (b) the endorsement system remains
closed and `closed_system_unfalsifiable` fires directly.

**Anomaly signaling.**  The system can emit anomaly signals but ignores them:
no endorsed claim becomes externally falsifiable from the signal alone.
The closure condition is preserved — signals without action leave the
endorsement-falsifiability structure unchanged.

**Partial contestation.**  Only some claims are contestable.  For the
non-contestable endorsed claims, the closure condition still holds.
The closed system theorem applies to that sub-population.

**Soft falsifiability.**  Claims can be flagged as uncertain but are not
actually falsifiable (not removed from endorsement).  If flagging does not
imply external falsifiability, the closure condition holds — the same
impossibility applies. -/

/-- Anomaly-signaling system: signals exist but do not make endorsed claims
    externally falsifiable. -/

/-! ### §6c. Forcing Stratification: Hard vs Soft Forcing for Truth Pressure

The six forcing dimensions do not all have the same tightness.

Hard forcing: impossibility follows from the structure alone, without additional
behavioral coverage assumptions.  Scope, revocation, bank, and partial contestation
belong to this tier.

Soft forcing: impossibility requires an additional coverage assumption
(`∀ c, endorsed c → emits_anomaly c` / `flagged c`), which cannot be
discharged from the structure fields alone.

`anomaly_not_hard_forced` and `soft_falsifiability_not_hard_forced` exhibit consistent
`AnomalySignaling` / `SoftFalsifiability` instances with an endorsed, externally-falsifiable
claim.  `partial_contestation_hard_forced` shows partial contestation does not require
a coverage assumption. -/

/-- Redeemability is hard-forced: `ClosedEndorsement` is self-refuting from its
    structural fields alone.  The impossibility fires unconditionally — no coverage
    assumption is needed. -/

/-! ## §7. GroundedX ↔ Impossibility Bridges

Each `GroundedX` structure is isomorphic to the *input* of the corresponding
impossibility theorem (§1–§6).  These bridge theorems make the connection
explicit: given any `GroundedX` witness, the matching impossibility result fires.

`GroundedXStrict` packages the base evidence with its impossibility consequence —
the non-trivial `Prop` that falls out of the bridge.  `mk'` derives that
consequence automatically from the base evidence alone.

**Relation to WorkingSystem.**  `WorkingSystem` now carries six `Option GroundedX`
fields directly.  `grounded_partial_wellformed` proves the biconditionals using
`grounded_spec_contains_all` (forward) and `rfl` (backward).  The `GroundedXStrict`
wrappers here go further: they attach formal impossibility consequences to the
base evidence, enabling richer downstream usage where the impossibility itself
must appear in a type or proof. -/
