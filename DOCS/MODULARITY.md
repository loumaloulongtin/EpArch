# Modularity Registry

This document is the single reference for how EpArch's theorem corpus is modular:
what surfaces exist, which are user-facing, how to add or remove a cluster, and
the invariants that must never be broken.

**Key question answered here:** If a product/sub-system rejects some constraint or
goal, which theorems still apply, which don't, and how does the formalization
certify that?

---

## 1. What Modularity Means in This Repo

EpArch's theorem corpus is sliced into **30 certified clusters** across six families.
Constraint, goal, and world clusters are config-driven — activated by the `EpArchConfig`
a user provides. Meta-modularity, lattice-stability, and all Tier 4 clusters (commitments,
structural, LTS-universal, and bank-goal transport) are always-on: they hold
unconditionally and require no configuration.

| Family | Count | What it covers |
|---|---|---|
| **Forcing clusters** (Tier 2) | 7 | Each constraint forces a structural feature. Two paths: (1) `StructurallyForced W`/`handles_X W` operational path — `StructurallyForced.forcing : ∀ P : Pressure, handles_pressure W P → forced_feature W P`; (2) structural `Represents*`/`*_forces_*` path — no `handles_X W`, no biconditionals, strictly stronger. Per-dimension `*_forces_*` theorems are orthogonal: each fires independently (`disagreement_forces_bubbles`, `private_coordination_forces_bank`, `monotonic_lifecycle_forces_revocation`, `discriminating_import_forces_headers`, `bounded_verification_forces_trust_bridges`, `closed_endorsement_forces_redeemability`, `uniform_access_forces_granular_acl`). |
| **Goal transport** (Tier 3) | 6 | Each health goal is preserved under compatible model extension |
| **Tier 4 library clusters** | 5 | Commitments pack, structural theorems, LTS-universal gates, bank-goal transport |
| **World obligations** (Tier 1) | 8 | Each `W_*` bundle enables a slice of adversarial/world theorems |
| **Meta-modularity** | 1 | `modular` — constraint-subset independence (`PartialWellFormed W S → projection_valid S W`) |
| **Lattice-stability** | 3 | `graceful_degradation`, `sub_revision_safety`, `modularity_pack` |

The 30 `ClusterTag` values in `ClusterRegistry.lean` are the canonical names for all of these.

**Why this matters architecturally:** Modularity is not only a proof-engineering convenience — it is a kernel design constraint. EpArch must remain applicable across agents that do not share the same internal epistemology or constraint bundle, including minimal agents (e.g., an odometer-like system tracking position) that face only a sub-bundle of the full set. The cluster architecture ensures the kernel scales down gracefully: a system that does not face `FallibilityConstraint` simply does not receive the clusters that depend on it, and the remaining claims stay sound. This is why the kernel boundary stops at coordination-relevant architectural requirements rather than agent-internal dynamics models.

**Structural forcing path (stronger than biconditionals):** Beyond the `PartialWellFormed`/`handles_X W` biconditional path, each Tier 2 cluster has a direct `Represents*`/`*_forces_*` proof that requires no `WellFormed`, no `handles_X W`, and no biconditionals. Any system that concretely instantiates one EpArch operational pressure (by supplying a `Represents*` witness) is forced to have the matching primitive. These seven theorems are strictly orthogonal — each fires independently. Bundled together, `SystemOperationalBundle W` (scope + headers + bank + authorization) and `WorldBridgeBundle W` (revocation + trust + redeemability) feed the headline `bundled_structure_forces_bank_primitives` theorem in Feasibility.lean: four arguments, any world, no `WorldCtx`.

### What exhaustiveness means here

EpArch does not claim that reality contains only seven possible pressures in every conceivable theory. It claims that, at EpArch's chosen agent-agnostic architectural boundary, the kernel currently recognizes seven pressure classes. The `Pressure` inductive type makes that inventory machine-exhaustive within the theory: every `cases P` in a proof is checked for coverage by Lean's kernel, so nothing can be silently missing.

A proposed eighth dimension is not a counterexample merely because it exists in some field-specific vocabulary. To qualify, it must:

1. live at the same agent-agnostic architectural level (not an implementation detail or domain-local jargon);
2. be a genuine operational pressure, not a sub-case of one of the existing seven;
3. admit the same forcing treatment — a `Represents*` structural witness, a `handles_*`/`Has*` pair, and the corresponding impossibility model.

If it fails that test, it is outside EpArch's scope rather than against it. If it passes, the theory extends cleanly: add a new `Pressure` constructor and the compiler immediately flags every `cases P` site that requires the new forcing chain to be supplied. The exhaustiveness is architectural discipline, not a metaphysical claim about the number of pressures in the world.

## 2. User-Facing vs. Internal

Three layers sit between a caller and the proof content. Understanding which layer
does what prevents confusion about where to look and where to edit.

### User-facing surface
- **`EpArchConfig`** — user-supplied record of `constraints`, `goals`, `worlds` lists.
- **`ClusterTag`** — the 30 cluster identifiers; what a user cites when requesting certification.
- **`certify`** — `certify : EpArchConfig → CertifiedProjection cfg`; returns a record with
  one indexed witness per family. Access proof content via:
  `(certify myConfig).goalWitnesses`, `.tier4Witnesses`, `.worldWitnesses`,
  `.metaModularWitnesses`, `.latticeWitnesses`.
- **`showConfig`** / `#eval` output — human-readable display; what appears when a user runs
  `#eval EpArch.Meta.Config.showConfig myConfig`.

### Routing/metadata layer — `Meta/ClusterRegistry.lean`
- Owns `ClusterTag`, all `EnabledXxxCluster` enumerations, `clusterEnabled`,
  and every `toClusterTag` mapping.
- **No EpArch-specific imports.** It is pure metadata — all types are self-contained.
- Changing a cluster's description, family, or enabled status: edit here only.

### Proof-carrying layer — `Meta/Config.lean`
- Owns the Tier 2 proof carriers (`ConstraintProof`, `ConstraintClusterSpec`) and the
  indexed witness inductives (`GoalWitness`, `Tier4Witness`, `WorldWitness`,
  `MetaModularWitness`, `LatticeWitness`).
- Each carrier/constructor holds the actual Lean type of the theorem being certified.
- Owns the `constraintSpec`, `goalWitness`, `worldWitness`, `tier4Witness`, etc. match arms
  that wire tags to proofs.
- Changing what a cluster certifies (its type or proof term): edit here.

### Theorem modules — source of actual proof content
- `Minimality.lean` — Tier 2 seven individual lifting theorems.
- `Convergence.lean` — `StructurallyForced`, `convergence_structural`, impossibility models, §1b–§7b alternative dismissals; seven per-dimension `*_forces_*` theorems; `SystemOperationalBundle W` and `WorldBridgeBundle W` record structures.
- `WorldBridges.lean` — `grounded_world_and_structure_force_bank_primitives` (explicit `Represents*` witnesses, no `WorldCtx`); `bundled_structure_forces_bank_primitives` (headline 4-argument form).
- `Theorems/BehavioralEquivalence.lean` — `GroundedBehavior`-indexed behavioral-equivalence results; step-bridge section grounds withdraw/challenge/tick via `ReadyState` witnesses and `behavior_from_step`.
- `Health.lean`, `Meta/TheoremTransport.lean` — Tier 3 goal predicates and transport.
- `Commitments.lean`, `Theorems/` (10 sub-modules), `Agent/*.lean`,
  `Invariants.lean`, `Semantics/ScopeIrrelevance.lean`, `ConditionalPredictions.lean`, `Concrete/WorkedTraces.lean` — Tier 4.
- `WorldCtx.lean`, `Adversarial/Obligations.lean`, `WorldWitness.lean` — Tier 1 / world.
- `Meta/Modular.lean` — meta-modularity; `Meta/TheoremTransport.lean` (§8) — lattice-stability; `Meta/LeanKernel/OdometerModel.lean` — concrete odometer sub-bundle.
- **Editing here does not change the cluster surface** unless Config.lean is updated too.

## 3. How to Add a New Cluster

Work through these layers **in order**. Each layer depends on the one above it.

### Step 1 — Prove or name the theorem in the source module

Add or identify the theorem in the appropriate `.lean` file.
It must be a fully closed term — no `sorry`, no empty structure fields.

```lean
-- Example: new Tier 2 forcing theorem in Minimality.lean
theorem my_constraint_requires_feature (W : WorkingSystem)
    (h : StructurallyForced W) (hC : handles_my_constraint W) : HasMyFeature W := ...
```

### Step 2 — Update `ClusterRegistry.lean`

Add a new `ClusterTag` constructor, the corresponding `EnabledXxxCluster` value,
`clusterEnabled`, and `toClusterTag` routing.

```lean
-- In ClusterTag inductive:
| forcing_my_constraint   -- Tier 2: my_constraint forces HasMyFeature

-- In constraintMeta (or equivalent routing function):
| .my_constraint => { globalTag := .forcing_my_constraint,
                      description := "my_constraint forces HasMyFeature",
                      ... }
```

### Step 3 — Update `Config.lean`

Add a constructor to the appropriate witness inductive and a match arm
in the certifying function.

```lean
-- In constraintSpec match (constraintProof is derived from this):
| .forcing_my_constraint => {
    statement := ∀ W, StructurallyForced W → handles_my_constraint W → HasMyFeature W
    proof     := fun W sf => sf.my_forcing }
```

### Step 4 — Update `MODULARITY.md`

Only needed if the new cluster changes the public modularity surface or the cluster
count. Add a row to the relevant family table.

---

## 4. Family-Specific Recipes

Not all families are added the same way. The asymmetry is architectural, not style.

### Tier 2 — Forcing clusters

Use **direct `ConstraintProof`**: the theorem takes `StructurallyForced W` plus the
operational predicate for that constraint and returns the forced feature.
No witness inductive is needed — the proof term is the carrier.

```lean
-- Minimal pattern:
theorem my_constraint_requires_feature (W : WorkingSystem)
    (h : StructurallyForced W) (hC : handles_my_constraint W) : HasMyFeature W :=
  ... -- prove from h and hC
```

### Goal / World / Tier 4 / Meta / Lattice — indexed witness carriers

These families use **indexed inductive witness types** in `Config.lean`.
The reason is universe management: the proof terms for these families are
polymorphic or involve `Type 1` universes (model parameters, `CoreModel`,
`WorkingSystem`), and bundling them into a plain function type causes universe
issues. The inductive carrier keeps each proof at its natural universe level.

```lean
-- Tier 4 pattern:
| my_cluster :
    (∀ {PL SL EL PrL : Type}, MyTheoremStatement PL SL EL PrL) →
    Tier4Witness .tier4_my_cluster

-- Match arm:
| .tier4_my_cluster => .my_cluster my_theorem
```

If you see existing clusters using `fun` terms in the match arm body, that is
because the carrier constructor accepts a `∀`-quantified type — the `fun` just
supplies the universally-quantified argument.

---

## 5. How to Remove or Refactor a Cluster

### Rule: no empty compatibility shells

If a theorem family becomes standalone (proved unconditionally, needs no transport),
move its cluster to reflect that reality. Do **not** leave a transport shell
containing vacuous or identity proofs just because it matched an old structure.

The `CommitmentsCtx` refactor (`5a1cdea`) is the canonical example:
`CommitmentsCtx` was an empty structure that did nothing; `commitments_pack` now
directly bundles the four unconditional commitment theorems with no wrapper.

### Refactor discipline — touch layers in this order

1. **Proof module** — remove or rewrite the theorem.
2. **`Config.lean`** — remove the witness constructor and match arm; rewire any
   callers to the new proof term.
3. **`ClusterRegistry.lean`** — update description, family, or remove the tag entirely.
4. **`MODULARITY.md`** — update tables and prose to match the new reality.
5. **Grep** — search for the old name across all files and kill every stale mention.
   (`git grep <old_name>` or the `scripts/audit.ps1` script.)

### Rule: update routing, witnesses, and descriptions together

A mismatch between the registry description and what the witness actually carries
is a documentation bug. The three layers must always agree:

- The `description` field in `ConstraintClusterMeta` (in `ClusterRegistry.lean`) says what is certified for Tier 2 clusters.
- The witness constructor type in `Config.lean` encodes exactly that.
- The proof term in the match arm delivers exactly the constructor type.

---

## 6. Minimal Copy-Paste Templates

### New Tier 2 forcing cluster

```lean
-- Minimality.lean
theorem my_constraint_requires_feature (W : WorkingSystem)
    (h : StructurallyForced W) (hC : handles_my_constraint W) : HasMyFeature W := ...

-- ClusterRegistry.lean — add to ClusterTag:
| forcing_my_constraint

-- ClusterRegistry.lean — add row in constraintMeta:
| .my_constraint => { globalTag := .forcing_my_constraint, ... }

-- Config.lean — add arm to constraintSpec match:
| .forcing_my_constraint => {
    statement := ∀ W, StructurallyForced W → handles_my_constraint W → HasMyFeature W
    proof     := fun W sf => sf.forcing .my_constraint (by exact hC) }
```

### New goal / world / Tier 4 cluster

```lean
-- Source module
theorem my_theorem {PL SL EL PrL : Type} ... : MyConclusion PL SL EL PrL := ...

-- ClusterRegistry.lean — add to ClusterTag:
| tier4_my_cluster  -- or goal_*, world_*, etc.

-- Config.lean — add to Tier4Witness (or GoalWitness, etc.):
| my_cluster :
    (∀ {PL SL EL PrL : Type}, MyConclusion PL SL EL PrL) →
    Tier4Witness .tier4_my_cluster

-- Config.lean — add match arm:
| .tier4_my_cluster => .my_cluster my_theorem
```

### New always-on meta cluster (unconditional, no universe polymorphism)

```lean
-- Source module
theorem my_meta_fact : MyMetaConclusion := ...

-- Config.lean — witness constructor (if MetaModularWitness family):
| my_meta :
    MyMetaConclusion →
    MetaModularWitness .meta_my_fact

-- Config.lean — match arm:
| .meta_my_fact => .my_meta my_meta_fact
```

---

## 7. Invariants — Do Not Break These

These rules prevent the registry, config, and docs from drifting apart.

| # | Invariant |
|---|---|
| **I1** | `ClusterRegistry.lean` owns all routing and display. No other file defines `clusterEnabled` or the `toClusterTag` mappings. |
| **I2** | `Config.lean` owns all proof carriers. Witness inductive constructors are the only place where theorem types are formally encoded against a `ClusterTag`. |
| **I3** | Named `cluster_*` proof witnesses (e.g. `commitments_pack`, `structural_theorems_unconditional`, `lts_theorems_step_universal`) remain the authoritative typed witnesses — either `def X := upstream_name` re-exports or explicit `theorem` declarations where the signature needs stating separately. Config.lean match arms must reference them by name, not re-prove inline. |
| **I4** | Every `ClusterTag` constructor that exists must have a matching witness constructor in `Config.lean` and a description in `ClusterRegistry.lean`. Orphaned tags are a build-time bug. |
| **I5** | Documentation describes the cluster semantics as they exist now. Stale historical scaffolding (old transport wrappers, superseded pack shapes) must be removed — not left as comments or empty shells. |
| **I6** | The cluster count (currently 30) is a documented fact. If you add or remove a cluster, update the count in this doc and in `README.md`. |

## 8. Reference: Tier Detail Tables

The following tables describe each tier in depth. For the summary view, see §1.
For contributor instructions, see §§3–7 above.

---

## Tier 1 — World Bundles (already fully modular)

**Mechanism:** Every world-level claim is conditioned on an explicit `W_*` structure.
Disabling a world assumption = not providing a proof of that structure.
The type system then mechanically excludes all and only the theorems that depended on it.

**Files:** `WorldCtx.lean`, `Adversarial/Obligations.lean`, `WorldWitness.lean`

| World Bundle | Fields | What it enables | File | Disable by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `W_lies_possible` | `some_false`, `unrestricted_utterance` | `lie_possible_of_W`, `all_agents_can_lie_of_W` | WorldCtx.lean | Not providing proof |
| `W_bounded_verification` | `verification_has_cost` | Bounded-audit necessity results | WorldCtx.lean | Not providing proof |
| `W_partial_observability` | `obs_underdetermines` | Underdetermination results | WorldCtx.lean | Not providing proof |
| `W_asymmetric_costs` | `export_cost`, `defense_cost`, `asymmetry` | Cost-asymmetry obligation theorems | WorldCtx.lean | Not providing proof |
| `W_spoofedV` | `broken_chain_no_path` | `spoofed_V_blocks_path_of_W` | Adversarial/Obligations.lean | Not providing proof |
| `W_lies_scale` | (lies-scale fields) | `lies_scale_of_W` | Adversarial/Obligations.lean | Not providing proof |
| `W_rolex_ddos` | (rolex/ddos fields) | `rolex_ddos_structural_equivalence_of_W` | Adversarial/Obligations.lean | Not providing proof |
| `W_ddos` | (ddos fields) | `ddos_causes_verification_collapse_of_W`, `ddos_to_centralization_of_W` | Adversarial/Obligations.lean | Not providing proof |

**Transport:** `transport_lies_possible`, `transport_lie_possible` in `WorldCtx.lean` — world bundles are already transported through compatible extensions.

**Coverage:** All `AdversarialObligations` theorems, all `WorldWitness` non-vacuity witnesses.

**Gap:** None. This tier is complete.

---

## Tier 2 — Constraints / Forcing Results (already modular by conjunction separation)

**Mechanism:** Each forcing dimension has two proof paths. The **preferred path** uses `StructurallyForced.forcing P`  — a single `∀ P : Pressure, handles_pressure W P → forced_feature W P` field that packages all seven `handles_X W → HasFeature_X W` implications. Each implication is independently justified by a structural impossibility model (`flat_scope_impossible`, `monotonic_no_exit`, etc.). The **strongest path** is the direct `Represents*`/`*_forces_*` route: seven per-dimension theorems in `Convergence.lean`, each taking a concrete `Represents*` witness with no `handles_*` predicate required.

The **preferred forcing path** is `StructurallyForced W → SatisfiesAllProperties W → containsBankPrimitives W` (`convergence_structural`). New forcing contributions should be added as implications inside `StructurallyForced.forcing`; adding an eighth `Pressure` constructor forces the proof to supply the eighth forcing chain.

**Files:** `Convergence.lean` (seven per-dimension `*_forces_*` theorems, `StructurallyForced`, `convergence_structural`, impossibility models); `Minimality.lean` (abstract scenario structures, §1b–§7b alternative dismissals); `Meta/Modular.lean` (modularity closure)

| Constraint | `Pressure` value | Forced feature | Theorem (Convergence.lean) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `distributed_agents` | `.scope` | `HasBubbles` | `disagreement_forces_bubbles` |
| `bounded_audit` | `.trust` | `HasTrustBridges` | `bounded_verification_forces_trust_bridges` |
| `export_across_boundaries` | `.headers` | `HasHeaders` | `discriminating_import_forces_headers` |
| `adversarial_pressure` | `.revocation` | `HasRevocation` | `monotonic_lifecycle_forces_revocation` |
| `coordination_need` | `.bank` | `HasBank` | `private_coordination_forces_bank` |
| `truth_pressure` | `.redeemability` | `HasRedeemability` | `closed_endorsement_forces_redeemability` |
| `multi_agent_authorization` | `.authorization` | `HasGranularACL` | `uniform_access_forces_granular_acl` |

**Global theorem:** `convergence_structural` = all seven implemented by `∀ P : Pressure, handles_pressure W P → forced_feature W P` (via `StructurallyForced`). If you only accept k constraints, the k individual forcing theorems not involving the dropped dimension still hold independently.

**Relation to world bundles:** `adversarial_pressure` is downstream of `W_lies_possible` (lies possible + imperfect gate → adversarial deposits pass). They operate at different layers and are not interchangeable.

**Gap:** ✅ Closed by `Meta/Modular.lean`. The two previously missing pieces are now proved:

1. **`PartialWellFormed W S`** — a biconditional-fragment type parameterized by a `ConstraintSubset` (7-Bool vector). For each constraint X with `S.X = false`, nothing is required. For `S.X = true`, the biconditional `handles_X W ↔ HasFeature_X W` is required.

2. **`modular`** — the universally-quantified meta-theorem:
   ```
   ∀ (S : ConstraintSubset) (W : WorkingSystem),
     PartialWellFormed W S →
       (S.distributed = true → handles_distributed_agents W → HasBubbles W) ∧ ...
   ```
   This is a machine-checked proof, not a structural observation. Dropping constraint X = setting `S.X := false`; the X-conjunct becomes vacuously true.

---

## Tier 3 — Health Goals (already CoreModel-parameterized)

**Mechanism:** All health goal predicates and their necessity theorems are stated over `CoreModel`.
This means they are already halfway to being transport-safe — the predicate moves with the model.

**File:** `Health.lean`

| Health goal | `CoreOps` fields it references | File | Disable by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SafeWithdrawalGoal` | `truth`, `obs`, `submit` | Health.lean | Not requiring it in your `SubBundle.SubGoal` |
| `ReliableExportGoal` | `submit`, `obs` | Health.lean | Not requiring it |
| `CorrigibleLedgerGoal` | `revise`, `hasRevision` | Health.lean | Not requiring it (→ `odometer_not_corrigible` in Meta/LeanKernel/OdometerModel.lean) |
| `SoundDepositsGoal` | `verifyWithin`, `effectiveTime` | Health.lean | Not requiring it |
| `SelfCorrectionGoal` | `selfCorrects`, `hasRevision` | Health.lean | Not requiring it |

**`RevisionGate`** (the competition gate) references only `selfCorrects`, `hasRevision` — the minimal slice needed for the revision gate.

**Transport:** `transport_core` (Semantics/RevisionSafety.lean) transports `RevisionGate` exactly.
`sub_revision_safety` (Meta/TheoremTransport.lean §8) transports `RevisionGate` at sub-bundle level.
`graceful_degradation` (Meta/TheoremTransport.lean §8) shows dropping `SelfCorrectionGoal` → `RevisionGate` holds vacuously.

**Gap:** ~~None~~ Closed. `transport_safe_withdrawal`, `transport_reliable_export`, `transport_sound_deposits`, `transport_self_correction` (and the full `transport_corrigible_ledger` via `SurjectiveCompatible`) are proved in `Meta/TheoremTransport.lean`. The `health_goal_transport_pack` headline theorem packages all five.

---

## Tier 4 — Main Theorem Library (transport schema complete)

**Files:** `Theorems/` (10 sub-modules: Withdrawal, Cases, Headers, Modal, Strip, Corners, Dissolutions, Pathologies, Diagnosability, BehavioralEquivalence), `Agent/Corroboration.lean`, `Agent/Resilience.lean`, `Invariants.lean`, `Semantics/ScopeIrrelevance.lean`, `ConditionalPredictions.lean`, `Concrete/WorkedTraces.lean`

**Status:** ✅ Closed by `Meta/Tier4Transport.lean`.

**Three transport clusters:**

### Cluster A — Standalone commitments theorem family

All 8 architectural commitments are proved as standalone theorems in `Commitments.lean`.
`commitments_pack` bundles the unconditional ones (C3/C4b/C7b/C8); C1, C2, C5, C6b
are proved as separately named theorems.  C4b (`redeemability_requires_more_than_consensus`)
is the commitment-specific result that distinguishes Cluster A from Cluster B
(`structural_theorems_unconditional`).  Cluster A is an unconditional theorem
family — no transport machinery needed.

Examples: `commitments_pack`, `innovation_allows_traction_without_authorization`,
`caveated_authorization_does_not_force_certainty`, `innovation_excludes_coordination`,
`redeemability_requires_more_than_consensus`, all Gettier/Lottery/Fake Barn diagnoses,
`header_stripping_produces_pathology`.

### Cluster B — Standalone structural theorems

These theorems carry no world, commitment, or ops hypothesis — universally valid.

| Theorem | What it proves |
|---|---|
| `SEVFactorization` | Every deposit has three independent header fields |
| `TemporalValidity` | Refreshed ≠ unrefreshed (τ-policy) |
| `monolithic_not_injective` | Diagnostic compression is non-injective |
| `header_stripping_harder` | Stripped deposits have lower diagnosability |

## 10. Product Compliance: Machine-Verifying Your Design Against EpArch

**Entry point:** `EpArch.Meta.Modular.partial_modular` in `Meta/Modular.lean`

If your application is written in Lean 4 (or modeled in Lean), you can obtain a
machine-verified EpArch compliance certificate by filling in a `PartialGroundedSpec`.
If it type-checks, the Lean kernel has formally verified that your design satisfies
every EpArch constraint in your profile.

### The Three-Step Workflow

**Step 1 — Choose your constraint profile**

Declare which EpArch operational pressures your product faces:

```lean
def MyConstraints : ConstraintSubset :=
  { distributed    := true   -- app has distributed agents
    adversarial    := true   -- app faces adversarial pressure
    bounded_audit  := false  -- full re-verification always available
    export_across  := false  -- no cross-boundary export needed
    coordination   := false  -- no shared ledger needed
    truth_pressure := false  -- no constraint-surface pressure
    multi_agent    := false  -- no multi-agent authorization needed }
```

**Step 2 — Supply domain evidence for each active constraint**

```lean
def MySpec : PartialGroundedSpec MyConstraints where
  -- Active: provide real domain-typed evidence
  bubbles    := fun _ => { Claim := MyScope, scope₁ := ..., scope₂ := ...,
                           witness := ..., scope₁_accepts := ..., scope₂_rejects := ... }
  revocation := fun _ => { Claim := MyEvent, valid := ..., revocable := ...,
                           witness := ..., witness_is_invalid := ..., can_revoke := ... }
  -- Inactive: vacuously inhabited (no obligation)
  trust_bridges   := fun h => absurd h (by decide)
  headers         := fun h => absurd h (by decide)
  bank            := fun h => absurd h (by decide)
  redeemability   := fun h => absurd h (by decide)
  authorization   := fun h => absurd h (by decide)
```

**Step 3 — Compile**

```lean
-- If this type-checks: machine-verified EpArch compliance for MyConstraints
#check (partial_modular MyConstraints MySpec)
```

### Constraint → Evidence Table

| `ConstraintSubset` field | EpArch constraint    | Required evidence type  | Key fields                                                |
|--------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `distributed`            | Distributed agents        | `GroundedBubbles`         | `scope₁`, `scope₂`, `witness`, disagree proof             |
| `bounded_audit`          | Bounded audit             | `GroundedTrustBridges`    | `upstream_accepts`, `downstream_via_bridge`               |
| `export_across`          | Export across bounds      | `GroundedHeaders`         | `extract`, `export_datum`, `header_preserved`             |
| `adversarial`            | Adversarial pressure      | `GroundedRevocation`      | `valid`, `revocable`, `witness_is_invalid`, `can_revoke`  |
| `coordination`           | Coordination need         | `GroundedBank`            | `agent₁_produces`, `agent₂_consumes`                      |
| `truth_pressure`         | Truth pressure            | `GroundedRedeemability`   | `constrained`, `redeemable`, `has_path`                   |
| `multi_agent`            | Multi-agent authorization | `GroundedAuthorization`   | `submitter`, `committer`, `tier_claim`, `may_propose`, `cannot_commit`, `may_commit` |

### Proof Chain

```
PartialGroundedSpec S          -- evidence for active constraints
      ↓ toWorkingSystem
WorkingSystem                  -- consistent behavioral + spec flags (dite-guarded)
      ↓ partial_grounded_is_partial_wellformed
PartialWellFormed W S          -- biconditionals hold for active constraints
      ↓ modular
projection_valid S W           -- forcing theorems certified ✓
```

### What the Guarantee Means

**Guaranteed (by type-checking):**
- All active constraints have structurally well-formed domain evidence
- Behavioral flags and spec flags are internally consistent (`PartialWellFormed`)
- For every active constraint X: if the system handles X, it has the required architectural feature

**Not guaranteed (model gap — universal to all formal methods):**
- That your `GroundedX` records accurately model your physical system's actual behavior
- That Lean's compiler produces a binary faithful to the verified source (Lean's compiler is not CompCert)

`EpArch/Meta/LeanKernel/World.lean` is the full research-level instantiation showing all seven
constraints simultaneously, plus the world layer (`LeanKernelCtx`), structural impossibility
theorems, and the convergence chain. It is not intended as a copy-paste template — it is the
proof that the Lean kernel itself is EpArch-compliant, and was built to discover and fix the
flag-bag soundness gap that motivated the `GroundedX` / `PartialGroundedSpec` API.
The S-failure taxonomy (axiom-footprint failure modes) lives in `EpArch/Meta/LeanKernel/SFailure.lean`.

For a new product, start with `PartialGroundedSpec` — not `LeanKernel/World.lean`.

**Mechanism:** None needed. `structural_theorems_unconditional` packages all four as a
machine-checked conjunction to formally certify the "no transport needed" status.

### Cluster C — SystemState/Step-concrete theorems

Shape: over `SystemState PropLike Standard ErrorModel Provenance` and `Step`.

Two sub-results fill this cluster:

**§3b — LTS-Universal Operational Theorems**  
The withdrawal/repair/submit theorems from `Theorems/Withdrawal.lean` are structurally identical to Cluster B:
they hold for **every** `SystemState`/`Step` instance by virtue of `Step` constructor preconditions.
No model parameter varies, so no transport mechanism is needed.

- `lts_theorems_step_universal`: packages four key LTS facts as unconditionally valid —
  - Withdrawal gates: `Step.Withdraw` requires ACL + current τ + Deposited status
  - Repair revalidation: `Step.Repair` produces Candidate ledger status
  - Repair quarantine: `Step.Repair` requires input to be Quarantined
  - Submit Candidate: `Step.Submit` produces at least one Candidate deposit

**§3c — All Five Health Goals Transport**  
All five ∀-health goals are preserved by any compatible extension of `ConcreteBankModel`.
This is the real Cluster C result — not just the competition gate but the full health-goal suite.

- `ConcreteBankModel`: concrete EpArch bank types form a valid `CoreModel`
- `concrete_bank_all_goals_transport`: given that a `ConcreteBankModel` satisfies all five goals,
  any `Compatible` extension satisfies all five:
  - `SafeWithdrawalGoal (forget E)`
  - `ReliableExportGoal (forget E)`
  - `SoundDepositsGoal (forget E)`
  - `SelfCorrectionGoal / RevisionGate (forget E)`
  - Universal `CorrigibleLedgerGoal (forget E)` (the ∃ component requires `SurjectiveCompatible`)
- `tier4_full_pack`: headline theorem — Clusters B + C only (structural + LTS-universal + all
  five health goals); Cluster A (`commitments_pack`) is certified separately.

**Gap:** None. All four tier 4 clusters are machine-certified:
- Cluster A: all 8 commitments proved as standalone theorems; `commitments_pack` bundles the unconditional ones.
- Cluster B + §3b LTS-universal: structural and operational LTS theorems are universally valid.
- Cluster C §3c: all five ∀-health goals transport through compatible `ConcreteBankModel` extensions.

## 9. Product / User Handbook

**"I want to disable constraint X for my product."**
→ Go to Tier 2. Find X in the constraint table. The k forcing theorems not involving X all still apply. The global `convergence_structural` no longer applies (it quantifies over all pressures; removing X means its `Pressure` dimension no longer has a justification).

**"I want to disable health goal G for my product."**
→ Go to Tier 3. Find G in the health goal table. Note which `CoreOps` fields it references.
→ Go to Tier 4, operation dependency map. Every theorem cluster that does *not* reference those fields survives. `RevisionGate` specifically is handled by Tier 3 (transport_core).

**"I want to disable world assumption W for my product."**
→ Go to Tier 1. Find W. Every theorem listed in that row becomes inapplicable. Everything else is unaffected — mechanically, by the type system.

**"I want to add my own constraint/goal on top."**
→ Tier 2: add a new `Pressure` constructor (e.g., `.myConstraint`) and supply the `handles_pressure`/`forced_feature` dispatch arms, plus the impossibility model; then prove the `StructurallyForced.forcing` obligation for that new constructor.
→ Tier 3: add a new `CoreModel`-parameterized predicate and its necessity theorem.
→ `Semantics/RevisionSafety.lean` `premise_strengthening` guarantees adding constraints can't invalidate existing implications.
